.Goals
[abstract]
Neo4j is supported by a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, drivers, and guides provided by partners, users and community contributors.
We want to give an overview about what's available and link to the original sources.
We try to focus on the freely available solutions here, and provide links to commercial options where appropriate.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a basic understanding of the Neo4j, its data model and query language.
Having installed and used Neo4j and perhaps even built an example application also helps understanding the various bits and pieces.
The different tools will require different levels of expertise.

== The Neo4j Ecosystem

Neo4j is first and foremost a graph *database*, it comes with an implementation of the database, a server and a web interface.
There are APIs, documentation and examples for operations, certain use-cases and applications.

To make it easy to integrate Neo4j into a system infrastructure there are many more aspects to be addressed.
Those additional aspects cover many different areas: drivers, visualization, ETL and BI tools, integration platforms, development tools.
Also additional frameworks and libraries on top of Neo4j that allow you to address certain problems faster and with less effort.

Being an open source database, we benefit from users and contributors in our ecosystem that invest time, effort and energy to provide those solutions.
We are very grateful for every individual contribution and try to make them visible and accessible to everyone.

[NOTE]
Please note that all these libraries, drivers and tools are *not officially supported by Neo Technology*.
Please reach out to the individual authors or contributors if you have questions or issues, or post on StackOverflow or the appropriate Google Group.
