== About GraphQL

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/GraphQL_Logo.svg/200px-GraphQL_Logo.svg.png[float=right,width=200]

GraphQL is a specification for querying a slice of an application graph, retrieving a tree of data that perfectly matches a front-end view, regardless of was that data was pulled from.
It covers tree-based read-queries, mutations for updates and subscriptions for live updates.

=== Queries

Queries form a tree structure, based upon entities and relevant attributes.
Any of those can take parameters (e.g for filtering or pagination) and directives.

.GraphQL example query
[source,graphql]
----
query {
   Movie(title:"The Matrix") {
      title
      released
      tagline
      actors {
         name
         born
      }
   }
}
----

.GraphQL example result
[source,json]
----
{
   "Movie": [{
      "title": "The Matrix",
      "released": 1999,
      "tagline": "Welcome to the Real World",
      "actors": [{
         "name": "Keanu Reeves",
         "born": 1964
         }, {
         "name": "Carrie-Anne Moss",
         "born": 1967
         }, {
         "name": "Laurence Fishburne",
         "born": 1961
         }
      ]
   }]
}
----

=== GraphQL as a Contract

In this regard it is a *contract* between front-end and back-end, based on the agreed upon type system which forms an application data model in the form of *a graph*.

It decouples the front-end from the back-end data source(s), which allows you to change both independently as the type system stays consistent.
Each query from the front-end is using that type system to define in a fine grained way which data it is interested in.

There is no prescription how and where the data in the back-end comes from, it can be anything from databases, to APIs, from third party systems to in-memory representations, and even code or static assets.

GraphQL queries return data in a tree-form that perfectly matches the front end view hierarchy. If the application data is a graph, then the perfect back-end is a Graph Database with native support for resolving GraphQL queries: Neo4j.

=== Schema

The typesystem is often declared in schema (IDL) files which contain entities, their attributes, interfaces, enumerations, but also mutations and subscriptions.
The schema can be extended with custom directives and types that allow specific extensions of the core language.

.GraphQL example schema
[source,graphql]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    released: Int
    tagline: String
    actors: [Person]
}

type Person {
    name: String!
    born: Int
    movies: [Movie]
}

=== Single Step Setup with neo4j-graphql-up

To get you up and running quickly, we provide the `neo4j-graphql-up` command-line tool.

----
npm install -g neo4j-graphql-up
neo4j-graphql up myfile.schema
----

This will:

. Launch a Neo4j Sandbox
. Install the neo4j-graphql extension
. Install your schema file into the database
. Provide you with URL and authentication
. Scaffold a local React project with those settings applied
////

=== Neo4j GraphQL extension

image::https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/graphql-community/raw/master/images/neo4j-graphql-logo.png[width=200,float=right]

We wanted to combine the power of Neo4j and GraphQL by making it super-easy to take an IDL schema OR an existing graph and serve a native GraphQL backend from it.

With the information from the schema we're able to generate a single query against the backing graph database.
During development both Neo4j's property graph model as well as the Cypher query language turned out to be a great fit for the GraphQL features we're supporting so far.

You can grab the latest release our extension from https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/releases[here] and drop it into any Neo4j 3.1.x server (in the `plugins` directory).
After a restart you can either query your graph data using GraphQL *directly* or after posting an IDL file with the schema you like.

We added some neat features that we hope are useful and make your life easier.

We're especially proud of the `@cypher` directive, the auto-generated mutations (create, update, delete), and the `graphql.execute`, `graphql.idl` and `graphql.schema` procedures.

Here is an example, how the schema definition above could / would be extended:

[source,graphql]
----
type Movie {
    title: ID!
    released: Int
    tagline: String

    actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:IN)

    director: Person @relation(name:"DIRECTED", direction:IN)

    recommendation(first:Int = 3): [Movie] 
      @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)<-[r1:REVIEWED]-(:User)-[r2:REVIEWED]->(reco:Movie) 
                         WHERE 3 <= r1.stars <= r2.stars 
                         RETURN reco, sum(r2.stars) as rating ORDER BY rating DESC")
}

interface Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int
}

type Actor extends Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int

    movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}

type Director extends Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int

    movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"DIRECTED")
}

type Mutations {
    directed(movie:ID! director:ID!) : String 
      @cypher(statement:"MATCH (m:Movie {title: $movie}), (d:Person {name: $director}) 
                         MERGE (d)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)")
}
schema {
   mutations: Mutations
}
----

Have a look at the following "feature" table, to see what else is "in the box":

In the repository, you can find a https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/blob/master/movies.schema[movies schmema] and https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/blob/master/movies.graphql[accompanying queries], that uses some of those features.


== GraphQL Community Graph Hackathon

=== The GraphQL Community 

GraphQL was originally developed at Facebook for their mobile applications and has since been widely used, especially in the React community.

GraphQL is defined as a language https://facebook.github.io/graphql/[specification^] with lots of detailed resources available.

// Besides Facebook, Apollo (Meteor), Graph.Cool, Scaphold.io, and Reindex are leading innovation in the GraphQL community.

Recently some larger sites (GitHub, Mattermark, Yelp) have been publishing APIs for developers not just as REST resources but also as GraphQL endpoints.

// There are many learning resources, tutorials, example applications, libraries about GraphQL available, and the community is growing at a rapid pace.
////

=== What is a Community Graph?

We found it very helpful and inspiring to bring the people and activities of the GraphQL-Community into one database with a GraphQL-API endpoint.

It contains tweets, github-repositories, stackoverflow-questions and answers and meetup events and the users and tags related to them.

No matter where you are active, your contributions should be visible.

And everyone in the community should be able to find new content, recent topics, active people or new events easily.

=== Hackathon

To learn more about what's important to the GraphQL community, *We'd love to challenge you!*

We're running a world-wide community Hackathon, starting now and running until end of day Monday, May 22.

Write a (mobile) demo, application, dashboard, visualization, timeline, react component, whatever you want against this GraphQL API, submit it here and also *TWEET* the link with link:https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23graphql%20%23neo4j[*#graphql #neo4j*] hashtags.

For the first 15 _valid_ submissions we offer a prize (a pair of AirPods or equivalent amazon-gift-card). 

Please http://bit.ly/graphqlhackathon[submit your work in this survey^] and tell us about your experience building it and your thoughts about GraphQL.

If you fill out the survey above, we'll send you a really cool graph t-shirt.

If you are attending http://graphql-europe.com[*GraphQL-Europe*^] we'd love you to *come by our booth and tell and show us in person*.

*Then you can get your t-shirt right away.*

=== GraphQL Support

To demonstrate the combined power of a graph database (Neo4j) and GraphQL we also added the GraphQL extension to this server. Access the GraphQL community graph, including GraphiQL http://graphql.communitygraph.org/[here].

After authorising you'll be able to query the GraphQL community graph with your trusted tools like GraphiQL or Apollo-Client. 
You can also visualize the Schema using Voyager.
