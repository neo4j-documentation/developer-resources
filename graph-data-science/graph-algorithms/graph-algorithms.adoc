[#graph-algorithms]
Graph algorithms provide one of the most potent approaches to analyzing connected data because their mathematical calculations are specifically built to operate on relationships.
They describe steps to be taken to process a graph to discover its general qualities or specific quantities.

== Neo4j Graph Data Science Library (GDSL)

Neo4j Graph Data Science is a library that provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j 3.x and Neo4j 4.x exposed as link:/developer/cypher/[Cypher] procedures.
It forms the core part of your link:/developer/graph-data-science[Graph Data Science platform^].

Amy Hodler and Alicia Frame also explain more about the library and share hands on examples in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziG_oPnxB20[this talk^] from the link:/connections/graph-data-science/[Connections: Graph Data Science^] event.

The library contains implementations for the following types of algorithms:

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/pathfinding/[Path Finding^] - these algorithms help find the shortest path or evaluate the availability and quality of routes

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/centrality/[Centrality^] - these algorithms determine the importance of distinct nodes in a network

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/community/[Community Detection^] - these algorithms evaluate how a group is clustered or partitioned, as well as its tendency to strengthen or break apart

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/similarity/[Similarity^] - these algorithms help calculate the similarity of nodes

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/linkprediction/[Link Prediction^] - these algorithms determine the closeness of pairs of nodes

* link:/docs/graph-data-science/1.3-preview/algorithms/node-embeddings/[Node Embeddings^] - these algorithms compute vector representations of nodes in a graph.
