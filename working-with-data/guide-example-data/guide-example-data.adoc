=== Importing Data Sets

The Zip files contain the contents of a Neo4j graph.db directory. To use them:

* Stop your Neo4j server
* Extract the file into /path/to/neo/data/graph.db
* Start the server again
* Open the Neo4j Web Interface
* Read about the Cypher Query Language
* Follow the source links for some example cypher queries
* All data sets are compatible with Neo4j version 1.6 and later.

You can also point the neo4j-shell to the extracted directory to run cypher-queries directly:
[source, shell]
----
/path/to/neo/bin/neo4j-shell -path /path/to/graph.db
