image::{img}neo4j-users-slack-group.png[link=http://neo4j.com/slack,float=right,width=300,window="neo4j-users-slack"]

The Neo4j Slack group took our user community to the next level, within a year more than 3000 people have joined us there, with 50-100 being active at any given time.

Unlike on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[StackOverflow^] here is a faster turnaround on quick questions and no exclusion of questions.

You can sign up here: http://neo4j.com/slack

With your account you can then find all the goodness of our community at http://neo4j-users.slack.com or in the Slack desktop app.
You can ask your first question right away in the https://neo4j-users.slack.com/messages/help[help channel,window="neo4j-users-slack"] or look at the <<channels>> below.

NOTE: Unfortunately with the free Slack plan, only 10.000 messages are kept. But we're building a separate archive.

== Channel Overview

There are *many* channels in our Neo4j-Users Slack group and Slack is not that good at organizing them.
We tried to help a bit by prefixing the channels but it's still not optimial.

That's why we provide this categorized listing here for you to quickly jump to any of the channels.
