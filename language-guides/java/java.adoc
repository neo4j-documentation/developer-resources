// tag::intro[]
=== Neo4j for Java Developers

Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for developers using Java or other JVM-languages.

The standalone Neo4j Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its *binary "Bolt" protocol* through our official driver or any bolt-enabled drivers.

The server's additional HTTP API is used by many other integrations, using drivers or any other HTTP client library.

You can also extend Neo4j by implementing *user defined procedures for Cypher* in Java or other JVM languages, writing *server extensions* which act as REST-endpoints or by embedding Neo4j into your own Java applications.

[NOTE]
Please note that starting with version 3.0 you need Java 8 to use Neo4j.

=== Spring Data Neo4j

image::{img}sdn.png[float="right"]

Neo4j's Spring Data integration was the founding project of the Spring Data efforts, started by Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem.
Spring Data Neo4j was recently rewritten to incorporate the many improvements in Neo4j and Cypher but also in the Spring Data ecosystem.

It integrates tightly with the http://spring.io/[Spring Framework] and offers Object-Graph mapping on top of Neo4j.

Features (based on Neo4j-OGM):

* Spring Boot Integration (since 1.4)
* annotation based object graph mapping
* interface based repository support with annotated and derived finder methods
* fast class metadata scanning
* optimized management of data loading and change tracking for minimal data transfers
* multiple transports: *binary protocol*, HTTP and embedded
* persistence lifecycle events

More detail can be found on the dedicated link:../spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] page.


[[neo4j-ogm]]
=== Object-Graph-Mapping with Neo4j-OGM

Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping rich domain models to your database.
The Neo4j-OGM library is a pure Java library that can persist (annotated) domain objects using Neo4j.
It uses Cypher statements to handle those operations in Neo4j.

The OGM supports tracking changes to minimize necessary updates and transitive persistence (reading and updating neighborhoods of an object).

The connection to Neo4j handled by a driver layer, which can use the binary protocol, HTTP or Neo4j's embedded APIs.

More detail can be found on the dedicated link:../neo4j-ogm[Neo4j OGM] page.


=== Using Neo4j's Embedded Java API

Being implemented in Java you can use Neo4j's link:/docs/java-reference/current/javadocs/[Java APIs] also directly in your programs, much like HSQL or Derby. 
This is great for unit testing, but also useful for very high performance requirements and single-tier setups.

Besides an object-oriented API to the graph database, working with `Node`, `Relationship`, and `Path` objects, it also offers highly customizable, high-speed traversal- and graph-algorithm implementations.

We don't provide extensive code examples for the Java API on this page, because they are covered in detail in the link:/docs/java-reference/current[Java developers manual] and other  articles (please adapt the cited Neo4j version to the one you use).

As a JVM developer you are also on the bright side when it comes to inserting large amounts of data into Neo4j.
With its non-transactional, highly-concurrent batch-insertion APIs it can ingest billions of nodes and relationships in just minutess.

Because of its flexibility and performance, we also chose the Java API for extending Neo4j as explained below.

* link:/docs/java-reference/current[Java developers manual]
* link:/docs/java-reference/current/javadocs/[API JavaDoc]
* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/neo4j/neo4j_java_introduction.htm[Tutorialspoint step-by-step Introduction]
* http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2415371[Inform-IT Tutorial on Java-API]
* https://maxdemarzi.com/tag/java/[Articles on the JavaAPI by Max de Marzi]

=== User Defined Procedures and Functions

link:/developer/cypher/procedures-functions[User Defined *Procedures* and *Functions*] are now available within Cypher and encapsulate dedicated functionality.

Just by annotating methods of a Java class and deploying the resulting jar file into your Neo4j installation, you can make new functionality easily available within the query language.

Neo4j uses that functionality itself for built-in procedures for meta-data, cluster-, query- and user-management and more.

Several libraries already provide new capabilities using procedures and functions, here is an example from the link:/developer/cypher/procedures-gallery#apoc[APOC] library.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (start:City {name: 'Berlin'}),(end:City {name: 'Malm√∂'})
CALL apoc.algo.dikjstra(start, end, "ROUTE","distance") yield path, weight
RETURN path
ORDER BY weight ASC LIMIT 10
----

To get you started we provided a https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-procedure-template[template project] and documentation in the link:/docs/java-reference/current/#procedures[Java developer manual].

More useful examples for user defined procedures can be found in our link:/cypher/procedures-gallery[procedure & function gallery].


[[server-extension]]
=== Extending Neo4j Server with a REST Server Extension

Another extension point are link:/docs/java-reference/current/#server-unmanaged-extensions[Neo4j Server REST extensions].
They encapsulate certain graph or business functionality behind a domain specific REST protocol which can be accessed using HTTP requests against the mounted extension points. 

After declaring the dependencies to Neo4j and Neo4j-Server-APIs you can create REST-resources that are made available by Jersey at startup.

Within those resources you can get access to all Neo4j Java APIs via the injected dependencies to perform any graph operation.

Their results are then collected and rendered in the required format, e.g. JSON, XML, plain text or binary.

You test your server extensions using the link:/docs/java-reference/current/#server-unmanaged-extensions-testing[neo4j-harness] tooling which allows to start an in-process Neo4j server to test against.

This {examples}/movies-java-server-extension[example project] shows how you would do that for our movie application endpoints.


[[neo4j-jdbc]]
=== Using Neo4j Server with JDBC

Being a Java developer you're probably familiar with JDBC as a way to work with relational databases, either directly or via abstractions like Spring's `JDBCTemplate` or MyBatis.
Many tools for ETL, Report Generators, Business Intelligence, and data management also use JDBC drivers to interact with relational databases.

As Cypher, like SQL, is a textual parametrizable query language that can return tabular results, it was possible for us to support the JDBC APIs and make a http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j-JDBC] driver available.

The driver supports the new binary "Bolt" protocol of Neo4j 3.x, the transactional http endpoint and Neo4j embedded connections.

[source, java]
----
// Connect
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost");

// Querying
try (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name");
	while (rs.next()) {
		System.out.println(rs.getString("n.name"));
	}
}
con.close();
----

More details on how to use it can be found with our example project for {examples}/movies-java-jdbc[Java-JDBC].
There, we implement the backend as a minimal Java webapp that leverages Neo4j-JDBC to connect to Neo4j Server.

:jdbc-tools-link: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

We tested the driver with many link:{jdbc-tools-link}[enterprise tools] to ensure that it works in a variety of environments.
Just grab the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/releases/latest[JAR of the latest release] and add it to your tool of choice.

[[jcypher]]
=== JCypher

JCypher provides seamlessly integrated Java access to Neo4j at different levels of abstraction:

At the topmost level of abstraction, JCypher allows you to *map complex business domains* to graph databases.
You can take an arbitrarily complex graph of domain objects or POJOs and store it in a straightforward way into Neo4j for later retrieval. 
You do not need to modify your domain object classes in any way, there is also no need for annotations. 
JCypher provides a default mapping out of the box.

At the same level of abstraction, *Domain Queries* provide the power and expressiveness of queries on a graph database, 
while being formulated on domain objects or on types of domain objects, respectively.
The true power of Domain Queries comes from the fact, that the graph of domain objects is backed by a graph database.

At the next lower level of abstraction ‚Äì access to graph databases ‚Äì is provided based on a generic graph model.
While simple, the model allows you to easily navigate and manipulate graphs. 

At the bottom level of abstraction, a *native Java DSL* in the form of a fluent Java API allows you to intuitively and comfortably formulate queries against Neo4j.

==== GraphAware Testing Framework

The GraphAware testing framework was developed as part of customer engagements and represents real-world testing experience with Neo4j.

It supports setup fixtures, database comparisions and testing of both Neo4j Server as well as embedded APIs.

// TODO MORE

Example:

[source,java]
----
----

==== NoSQL-Unit

=== Testing Neo4j Applications

Depending on the deployment mode, you test your Neo4j backed application differently.

==== Unit Testing

Applications using Neo4j in embedded mode and server extensions can be tested using the in-memory impermanent Graph Database instance.
The Neo4j Manual has a complete section on this topic.

You can obtain an instance of it like this:

[source,java]
----
----

Please make sure that your transactions are all completed (closed after `failure` or `success` calls) and the database is shut down correctly. 
Otherwise you might experience delays (transaction grace period) or leaks while tearing down your tests.

[source,java]
----
ImpermanentGraphDatabase db = new TestGraphDatabaseFactory().newImpermanentDatabase();

// or

ImpermanentGraphDatabase db = new TestGraphDatabaseFactory().newImpermanentDatabaseBuilder()
        .setConfig(...).newGraphDatabase();
----

It also has a `cleanContent()` method which you can run between tests to clean out newly created data.

If you use transaction around your test you can also rollback the transaction at the end to reset the database to its previous state.

==== Testing Server Extensions

Neo4j 2.2 introduces a {manual}/server-unmanaged-extensions-testing.html[new module] that makes it easier to test Neo4j Server and server extensions: `neo4j-harness`.

After adding `org.neo4j.test:neo4j-harness:${neo4j.version}` to your dependency setup you can use both a builder to create Neo4j server instances as well as a JUnit Rule to achieve the same:

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public Neo4jRule server = new Neo4jRule().withExtension("/test", TestResource.class);

@Test public void testWithRule() {
   HTTP.Response response =
           HTTP.withBaseUri(server.httpURI().toString())
               // optional
               .withHeaders("accept", "application/json").GET("test/foo/42");

   assertEquals(200, response.status());
   assertEquals(4711, response.<Map>content().get("value"));
   
}

@Test public void testWithBuilder() {
   try (ServerControls server TestServerBuilder.newInProcessBuilder().withConfig(...)
                                    .withFixture(...).withExtension(...).newServer()) {

      server.httpsUrl() ....
   }
}
----

==== GraphAware Testing Framework

The GraphAware testing framework was developed as part of customer engagements and represents real-world testing experience with Neo4j.

It supports setup fixtures, database comparisions and testing of both Neo4j Server as well as embedded APIs.

// TODO MORE

Example:

[source,java]
----
----

==== NoSQL-Unit

Alex Soto's http://[NoSQL-Unit] allows testing of various NoSQL databases.

For Neo4j it provides support for testing the embedded mode as well as Spring Data Neo4j.

==== Testing with a real Neo4j Server

If you don't want or can't use the server testing infrastructure mentioned above, 
you can quickly spin up a Neo4j server for testing in a temporary directory.

[NOTE]
Just make sure that you set-up auth before either by disabling it or by pre-seeding the server with a known password by either copying a `data/dbms/auth` file or by calling the "change password endpoint" upfront with the default credentials.

Travis CI (config) and also http://graphenedb.com[GrapheneDB] (API) provide options to provision Neo4j instances programmatically.
