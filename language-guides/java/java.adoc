.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Java developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.
While this guide is not comprehensive, it will introduce the different APIs and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with the link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
Having link:/download[installed Neo4j] and tried out our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language] helps too.
When developing with Neo4j, please use Java 8 or 11 and your favorite IDE.

Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for developers using Java or other JVM-languages.

The standalone Neo4j Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its *binary "Bolt" protocol* through our official driver or any bolt-enabled drivers.

You can also extend Neo4j by implementing *user defined procedures for Cypher* in Java or other JVM languages.

[NOTE]
Please note the minimum version compatibilities: +
Neo4j Server 3.x - Java 8 +
