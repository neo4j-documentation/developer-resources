[#neo4j-java]
== Neo4j for Java Developers

image::{img}java.jpg[float=right,width=200]

Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for developers using Java or other JVM-languages.

The standalone Neo4j Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its *binary "Bolt" protocol* through our official driver or any bolt-enabled drivers.

You can also extend Neo4j by implementing *user defined procedures for Cypher* in Java or other JVM languages.

[NOTE]
Please note that starting with version 3.0 you need Java 8 to use Neo4j Server.

[#java-spring]
== Spring Data Neo4j

image::{img}sdn.png[float="right"]

Neo4j's Spring Data integration was the founding project of the Spring Data efforts, started by Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem.
Spring Data Neo4j was recently rewritten to incorporate the many improvements in Neo4j and Cypher but also in the Spring Data ecosystem.

It integrates tightly with the http://spring.io/[Spring Framework^] and offers Object-Graph mapping on top of Neo4j.

Features (based on Neo4j-OGM):

* Spring Boot Integration
* annotation based object graph mapping
* interface based repository support with annotated and derived finder methods
* fast class metadata scanning
* optimized management of data loading and change tracking for minimal data transfers
* multiple transports: *binary protocol*, HTTP and embedded
* persistence lifecycle events

More detail can be found on the dedicated link:../spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] page.

[#java-ogm]
== Object-Graph-Mapping with Neo4j-OGM

Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping rich domain models to your database.
The Neo4j-OGM library is a pure Java library that can persist (annotated) domain objects using Neo4j.
It uses Cypher statements to handle those operations in Neo4j.

The OGM supports tracking changes to minimize necessary updates and transitive persistence (reading and updating neighborhoods of an object).

The connection to Neo4j handled by a driver layer, which can use the binary protocol, HTTP or Neo4j's embedded APIs.

=== Using Neo4j's Embedded Java API

Being implemented in Java you can use Neo4j's link:/docs/java-reference/current/javadocs/[Java APIs^] also directly in your programs, much like HSQL or Derby. 
This is great for unit testing, but also useful for very high performance requirements and single-tier setups.

Besides an object-oriented API to the graph database, working with `Node`, `Relationship`, and `Path` objects, it also offers highly customizable, high-speed traversal- and graph-algorithm implementations.

We don't provide extensive code examples for the Java API on this page, because they are covered in detail in the link:/docs/java-reference/current[Java developers manual^] and other  articles (please adapt the cited Neo4j version to the one you use).

As a JVM developer you are also on the bright side when it comes to inserting large amounts of data into Neo4j.
With its non-transactional, highly-concurrent batch-insertion APIs it can ingest billions of nodes and relationships in just minutess.

Because of its flexibility and performance, we also chose the Java API for extending Neo4j as explained below.

[#custom-proc-func]
== User-Defined Procedures and Functions

link:/developer/cypher/procedures-functions[User Defined *Procedures* and *Functions*^] are available within Cypher and encapsulate dedicated functionality.

Just by annotating methods of a Java class and deploying the resulting jar file into your Neo4j installation, you can make new functionality easily available within the query language.

To implement your procedures or functions you would use the Neo4j Embedded Java API.
Besides an object-oriented API to the graph database, working with `Node`, `Relationship`, and `Path` objects, it also offers highly customizable, high-speed traversal- and graph-algorithm implementations.

We don't provide code examples for the Java API on this page, because they are covered in detail in the link:/docs/java-reference/current[Java developers manual^].

Neo4j uses that functionality itself for built-in procedures for meta-data, cluster-, query- and user-management and more.

Several libraries already provide new capabilities using procedures and functions, here is an example from the link:/developer/cypher/procedures-gallery#apoc[APOC] library.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (start:City {name: 'Berlin'}),(end:City {name: 'Malmö'})
CALL apoc.algo.dikjstra(start, end, "ROUTE","distance") yield path, weight
RETURN path
ORDER BY weight ASC LIMIT 10
----

To get you started we provided a https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-procedure-template[template project^] and documentation in the link:/docs/java-reference/current/#procedures[Java developer manual^].

More useful examples for user defined procedures can be found in our link:/developer/procedures-gallery/[procedure & function gallery].

////
[[server-extension]]
=== Extending Neo4j Server with a REST Server Extension

Another extension point are link:/docs/java-reference/current/#server-unmanaged-extensions[Neo4j Server REST extensions^].
They encapsulate certain graph or business functionality behind a domain specific REST protocol which can be accessed using HTTP requests against the mounted extension points. 

After declaring the dependencies to Neo4j and Neo4j-Server-APIs you can create REST-resources that are made available by Jersey at startup.

Within those resources you can get access to all Neo4j Java APIs via the injected dependencies to perform any graph operation.

Their results are then collected and rendered in the required format, e.g. JSON, XML, plain text or binary.

You test your server extensions using the link:/docs/java-reference/current/#server-unmanaged-extensions-testing[neo4j-harness^] tooling which allows to start an in-process Neo4j server to test against.

This {examples}/movies-java-server-extension[example project] shows how you would do that for our movie application endpoints.

[#neo4j-jdbc]
=== Using Neo4j Server with JDBC

Being a Java developer you're probably familiar with JDBC as a way to work with relational databases, either directly or via abstractions like Spring's `JDBCTemplate` or MyBatis.
Many tools for ETL, Report Generators, Business Intelligence, and data management also use JDBC drivers to interact with relational databases.

As Cypher, like SQL, is a textual parametrizable query language that can return tabular results, it was possible for us to support the JDBC APIs and make a http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j-JDBC^] driver available.

The driver supports the new binary "Bolt" protocol of Neo4j 3.x, the transactional http endpoint and Neo4j embedded connections.

[source,text/x-java]
----
// Connect
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:neo4j:bolt://localhost");

// Querying
try (Statement stmt = con.createStatement()) {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name");
	while (rs.next()) {
		System.out.println(rs.getString("n.name"));
	}
}
con.close();
----

More details on how to use it can be found with our example project for {examples}/movies-java-jdbc[Java-JDBC^].
There, we implement the backend as a minimal Java webapp that leverages Neo4j-JDBC to connect to Neo4j Server.

:jdbc-tools-link: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

We tested the driver with many link:{jdbc-tools-link}[enterprise tools^] to ensure that it works in a variety of environments.
Just grab the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/releases/latest[JAR of the latest release^] and add it to your tool of choice.

[#java-jcypher]
=== JCypher

JCypher provides seamlessly integrated Java access to Neo4j at different levels of abstraction:

At the topmost level of abstraction, JCypher allows you to *map complex business domains* to graph databases.
You can take an arbitrarily complex graph of domain objects or POJOs and store it in a straightforward way into Neo4j for later retrieval. 
You do not need to modify your domain object classes in any way, there is also no need for annotations. 
JCypher provides a default mapping out of the box.

At the same level of abstraction, *Domain Queries* provide the power and expressiveness of queries on a graph database, 
while being formulated on domain objects or on types of domain objects, respectively.
The true power of Domain Queries comes from the fact, that the graph of domain objects is backed by a graph database.

At the next lower level of abstraction – access to graph databases – is provided based on a generic graph model.
While simple, the model allows you to easily navigate and manipulate graphs. 

At the bottom level of abstraction, a *native Java DSL* in the form of a fluent Java API allows you to intuitively and comfortably formulate queries against Neo4j.
