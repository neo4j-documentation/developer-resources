.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a JavaScript developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.
While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different Drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

[#neo4j-javascript]
== Neo4j for JavaScript Developers

Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its binary and HTTP APIs. 

You can use the official driver for JavaScript (neo4j-driver) or connect via HTTP using the `request` module or any of our community drivers.

[#js2neo-lib]
=== js2neo

As a demonstration of a minimal JavaScript based bolt driver, Nigel Small put together http://js2neo.org/[js2neo^].

[#js-http-endpoint]
== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the link:/docs/http-api/current/introduction/[Neo4j Manual^].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source, javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit";
function cypher(query,params,cb) { 
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)}) 
}
----

.Running the Function
[source, javascript]
---- 
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }
 
cypher(query,params,cb)
 
{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}
