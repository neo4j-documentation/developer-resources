.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Go developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.
While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

You can use the official driver for Go (neo4j-go-driver) or connect via Bolt or HTTP with any of our community drivers.

[#golang-bolt]
=== Golang Neo4J Bolt Driver

This implementation attempts to follow the best practices as per the Bolt specification, but also implements compatibility with Golang's `sql.driver` interface.

It is recommended that you use the Neo4j Bolt-specific interfaces if possible.
The implementation is more efficient and can more closely support the Neo4j Bolt feature set.

Features

* Neo4j Bolt low-level binary protocol support
* Message Pipelining for high concurrency
* Connection Pooling
* TLS support
* Compatible with sql.driver

=== CQ

A database/sql implementation for Cypher inspired by the http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/[database/sql^] package which provides idiomatic go database access.
Cypher is close enough to SQL that it seems to fit pretty well in the database/sql implementation.
