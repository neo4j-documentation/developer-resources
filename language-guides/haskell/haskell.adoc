.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Haskell developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting from Haskell to Neo4j.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

=== Hasbolt

Haskell driver for Neo4j 3+ (BOLT protocol).

The package covers:

* Data serialization and deserialization
* Nodes, relationships and paths support
* Cypher queries and responses
* Authentification

The code was tested with neo4j versions 3.0 and 3.1.

The https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-haskell-bolt[example movie database application] uses https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty[Scotty] as a web framework and comes with detailed documentation, including deployment instructions to Heroku.

=== Haskell-Cypher

Haskell-Cypher makes it easy to send Cypher commands to Neo4j servers over their REST API.
Additionally, it allows users to parse Haskell datatypes from Cypher queries.
It's meant to be used in conjunction with the aeson package.
