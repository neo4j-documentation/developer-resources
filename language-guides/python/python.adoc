.Goals
[abstract]
This guide provides an overview of how to connecting to Neo4j from Python.
While it is not comprehensive, it aims to introduce the available drivers and links to other relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
* You should be familiar with link:/developer/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
* You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher-query-language[Cypher query language].
* We also recommend installing and becoming familiar with both https://pip.pypa.io/[pip^] and https://virtualenv.pypa.io/[virtualenv^] before working on a Python project.

[#neo4j-python]
== Neo4j and Python

Neo4j can be installed on any system and then accessed via its binary and HTTP APIs. 

You can use the official binary driver for Python (neo4j-python-driver) or connect via HTTP with any of our community drivers.

[#python-driver]
== Neo4j Python Driver

include::../_includes/sample_project.adoc[]

include::../_includes/community-driver-notice.adoc[]

For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python^], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^].

While Python 3 is preferred, some drivers still support Python 2, please check with the individual project if you need it.

While we do not provide a specific web framework recommendation, both the lightweight http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask^] and the more comprehensive https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django^] frameworks are known to work well.
