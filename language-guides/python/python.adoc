.Goals
[abstract]
This guide provides an overview of how to connecting to Neo4j from Python.
While it is not comprehensive, it aims to introduce the available drivers and links to other relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher-query-language[Cypher Query language].

// tag::intro[]
For anyone working with https://www.python.org/[Python], the Neo4j community have contributed a range of driver options.
These range from lightweight to comprehensive driver packages as well as libraries designed for use with web frameworks such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django].
The Python sub-community is well-established for Neo4j, having existed for well over three years.

Many Pythonistas have invested a lot of time and love to develop these libraries, so if you use them, please provide feedback to the authors and help us improve.

== Py2neo

Py2neo is a client library and comprehensive toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line.
The core library has no external dependencies and has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.

Author:: https://twitter.com/neonige[Nigel Small]
Website:: http://py2neo.org/
Source:: https://github.com/nigelsmall/py2neo
Package:: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2neo
Documentation:: http://py2neo.org/
Python:: 2.7 / 3.3 / 3.4
Neo4j:: 1.8 / 1.9 / 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2

=== Installation
....
pip install py2neo
....

=== Example
....
from py2neo import Graph, Path
graph = Graph()

tx = graph.cypher.begin()
for name in ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]:
    tx.append("CREATE (person:Person {name:{name}}) RETURN person", name=name)
alice, bob, carol = [result.one for result in tx.commit()]

friends = Path(alice, "KNOWS", bob, "KNOWS", carol)
graph.create(friends)
....

== Neo4jRestClient

The main goal of neo4j-rest-client was to enable Python programmers already using Neo4j locally through python-embedded_, to use the Neo4j REST server.
So the syntax of neo4j-rest-client’s API is fully compatible with python-embedded.
However, a new syntax is introduced in order to reach a more pythonic style and to enrich the API with the new features the Neo4j team introduces.
