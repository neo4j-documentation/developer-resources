Members of the Perl community have invested a lot of time and love to develop a driver for Neo4j, so if you use it, please provide feedback to the authors.

[#neo4p-rest]
== REST::Neo4p

The Perl driver from Mark Jensen is always up to date with the latest Neo4j API developments, and it's fun to use too.
It works with the Neo4j’s REST API by using Perl5 objects in a consistent, idiomatic Perl-style.
