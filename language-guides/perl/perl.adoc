Members of the Perl community have invested a lot of time and love to develop drivers for Neo4j, so if you use them, please provide feedback to the authors.

[#neo4p-rest]
== REST::Neo4p

This Perl driver from Mark Jensen works with Neo4j’s REST API by using Perl5 objects in a consistent, idiomatic Perl-style.  There is also a related DBI-compliant wrapper (https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::Neo4p[DBD::Neo4p])

[#neo4j-driver]
== Neo4j::Driver

This is a Perl driver by Arne Johannessen. It enables interacting with a Neo4j server using the same classes and method calls as the official Neo4j drivers.  It also has (currently experimental) support for HTTPS and Bolt.

[#neo4j-bolt]

This is another driver from Mark Jensen. It's implemented as a Perl wrapper around the libneo4j-client C library, which implements the Bolt network protocol.
