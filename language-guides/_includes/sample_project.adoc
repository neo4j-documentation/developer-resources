=== The Example Project

The Neo4j example project is a small, one page webapp for the movies database built into the Neo4j tutorial.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers: movie search, movie details, and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from each of the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:../example-project[here].
You will find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?q=movies[individual GitHub repositories], which you can clone and deploy directly.
