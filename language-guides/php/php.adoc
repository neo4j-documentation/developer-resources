[#neo4j-php]
== Neo4j for PHP Developers

image::{img}php_logo.png[float=right,width=300]

You're a PHP developer and want to start with Neo4j?
Here you go.

Whether you're using frameworks like Symfony and Laravel or you're developing without frameworks, you'll find an adequate library for your use case.

If you have any questions, you can always find a community member around on the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Online Community^].

[#standalone-php]
== Using Neo4j in a standalone PHP environment

If you prefer to develop without frameworks, these libraries are made for you:
////
The BOLT driver itself is located at https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-bolt-php

I don’t expect a lot of people to use directly this repository, but they can if they want to use bolt only

The Client is located at https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-client and embraces the bolt driver and the http driver. Both Bolt and http use the API defined in the TCK, so if they want to switch from http to bolt and vice versa it is just a change in the url.

Concerning documentation, currently I have only the README.

[#graphaware-php]

[#graphaware-ogmphp]
== GraphAware OGM for Neo4j and PHP

GraphAware Neo4j-PHP-OGM is an object graph mapper for Neo4j in PHP. Highly inspired by Doctrine2, it uses annotations
to defined mapping and all the operations to the graph are centralized via an EntityManager.

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace Movies;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use GraphAware\Neo4j\OGM\Annotations as OGM;

/**
 * @OGM\Node(label="Movie")
 */
class Movie
{
    /**
     * @OGM\GraphId()
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @OGM\Property(type="string")
     * @var string
     */
    protected $title;

    /**
     * @OGM\Property(type="string")
     * @var string
     */
    protected $tagline;

    /**
     * @OGM\Property(type="int")
     * @var int
     */
    protected $release;

    /**
     * @OGM\Relationship(type="ACTED_IN", direction="OUTGOING", targetEntity="Person", collection=true)
     * @var ArrayCollection|Person[]
     */
    protected $actors;

    /**
     * @param string $title
     * @param string|null $release
     */
    public function __construct($title, $release = null)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->release = $release;
        $this->actors = new ArrayCollection();
    }
    // Getters and Setters
----

[source, php]
---- 
<?php

$user = new User('cypher666');
/** @var Movie $movie */
$movie = $em->getRepository(Movie::class)->findOneBy('title', 'The Matrix');
$user->rateMovie($movie, '4.5');
$em->persist($user);
$em->flush();

[#neo4j-symfony]
== Neo4j Symfony Bundle

To provide a smooth integration between Neo4j and Symfony we’ve created the SymfonyNeo4jBundle. 
It wraps the excellent PHP community client by Graphaware and creates a solid Symfony experience. 
Thanks to the WebProfiler integration, you will see all your database calls, all the queries and their results, exceptions and statistics. 

The bundle also integrates the client events with the Symfony event dispatcher. 
It is not opinionated in how you are using Neo4j and using the OGM is optional. 
Advanced Neo4j users will have full control over the client and what Cypher gets executed.

==== neo4j-pdo

This is a PHP Data Objects driver for the Neo4j graph database, it allows you to connect to a Neo4j server from PHP using the standard PDO API.
The project currently only implements a “vanilla” PHP implementation, which means you need to use a special constructor to create your PDO connection.
PHP extensions to register the driver with PDO in HHVM and Zend VM are planned future work.
