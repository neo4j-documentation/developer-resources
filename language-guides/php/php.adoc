=== Neo4j for PHP Developers

image::http://i.imgur.com/eTLVfHM.png[]

You're a PHP developer and want to start with Neo4j?
You're in the right place!

Whether you're using frameworks like Symfony and Laravel or you're developing without frameworks, you'll find an adequate library for your use case.

If you have any questions, you can always find a community member around on Twitter or StackOverflow by tagging your subjects with #neo4j-php.

// end::intro[]

Members of the PHP community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them provide feedback to the authors.

=== Using Neo4j in a standalone PHP environment

If you prefer to develop without frameworks, these libraries are made for you:

=== Neo4jPHP

Neo4jPHP provides an API that is both intuitive and flexible, and it takes advantage of ‘under-the-hood’ performance enhancements, such as caching and lazy-loading.

=== NeoClient

NeoClient is a powerful and flexible PHP Client for Neo4j with MultiDB support and full High-Availibilty support for Neo4j Enterprise and a convenient object formatter for handling graph results.
It is built on top of the Symfony components, which makes integrating it in a modern PHP framework very easy.
The 2.0 stable release has been announced end of November 14, with the following changes and improvements:

- Everything is built as an extension, meaning the core commands are an extension to the library, which makes the library very flexible and customizable.
- All commands are registered as lazy services, improving the library performance.
- The Service Container can be cached, gaining up to 300% performance when runnning in production.
- Full High-Availibilty support, with master re-election detection, slaves fallback built-in mechanism, and convenience methods for directing write and read queries to different databases.
- Minimalistic HA mechanism when running Neo4j Community Edition
- Full-bledged Response Graph format.

=== Neo4j-OGM-PHP

This library provides a basic Object-Graph mapping system and is built on top of Doctrine and the Neo4jPHP library.

=== You use the Symfony framework

If you're using the Symfony framework, these bundles are available to you:

=== Neo4jOGMBundle

This bundle is wraps the Neo4j-PHP-OGM library mentioned above.

=== Other Drivers

==== neo4j-pdo


This is a PHP Data Objects driver for the Neo4j graph database, it allows you to connect to a Neo4j server from PHP using the standard PDO API.
The project currently only implements a “vanilla” PHP implementation, which means you need to use a special constructor to create your PDO connection.
PHP extensions to register the driver with PDO in HHVM and Zend VM are planned future work.

==== PHP Cypher

A PHP adapter for Neo4j ReST API cypher endpoint.
PHP Cypher aims to take the pain out of sending Cypher query to Neo4j server.
I believe that Cypher will be a major part of Neo4j in near future.
In short, this library focus solely on sending query to Neo4j database.
Those looking for adapter on all the Neo4j ReST API can try this great library.
