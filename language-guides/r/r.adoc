==== RNeo4j

Written by our own data scientists Nicole White, out of a need to combine the analytics abilities of R with the interconnected data in Neo4j, the
RNeo4j package not only offers convenient access to Neo4j but also idiomatic integration with R the language and the R-Studio environment.

Nicole also details the usage in a number of blog posts and applications.

Compatible with Neo4j >= 2.0.
