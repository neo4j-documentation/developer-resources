.Goals
[abstract]
If you are an R developer or data scientist, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting from R to Neo4j and even using Neo4j from within R-Studio.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j^] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

== Neo4j for R Developers and Data Scientists

=== Neo4R

The goal of {neo4r} is to provide a modern and flexible Neo4J driver for R.

It’s modern in the sense that the results are returned as tibbles whenever possible, it relies on modern tools, and it is designed to work with pipes. 
Our goal is to provide a driver that can be easily integrated in a data analysis workflow, especially by providing an API working smoothly with other data analysis (`{dplyr}` or `{purrr}`) and graph packages (`{igraph}`, `{ggraph}`, `{visNetwork}`…).

It was developed by https://thinkr.fr/[ThinkR], led by Colin Fay.

Currently it connects to Neo4j via Http but we plan to integrate it with the C-connector for Bolt, Seabolt.

=== RNeo4j

RNeo4j was written by our own data scientists https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^], to combine the analytics abilities of R with the interconnected data in Neo4j.
The RNeo4j package not only offers convenient access to Neo4j but also idiomatic integration with R the language and the R-Studio environment.

Nicole also detailed the usage in a number of blog posts and applications.
