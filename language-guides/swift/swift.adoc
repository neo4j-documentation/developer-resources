.Goals
[abstract]
If you are an iOS, macOS or Linux developer using Swift, this guide provides instructions for how to use the https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo^] framework to interact with Neo4j. 

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j^] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher query language].

[#neo4j-swift]
== Neo4j for Swift Developers

Swift is a great language for writing iOS and macOS apps, and with the introduction of Swift 3.0, it has become a great language for writing server side applications as well. All of which are excellent places to use Neo4j.

[#theo-lib]
=== Theo

https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo^], the Swift framework for interfacing Neo4j, is now available in it’s version 3.0.

With this version, Theo gets full support for Swift 3, Linux support, and better integration with popular package managers. This on top of features you already expect, like CRUD operations for nodes and relationships, cypher support and transaction support.

Apart from reading the detailed instructions, you can take a look at our https://github.com/niklassaers/theo-example[example project^] for how to use Theo in your iOS project.

Theo is available for iOS, macOS and Linux, using package managers such as the https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#swift-package-manager[Swift Package Manager^], https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#cococapods[CocoaPods^] and https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#carthage[Carthage^], as well as a https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#git-submodule[git submodule^], regardless if your app is written in Objective-C or Swift.

You can also easily integrate it in server side swift project on macOS or Linux as a git submodule or the Swift Package Manager. If you are new to server side swift development, we recommend you try Theo out together with http://qutheory.io[Vapor^]. Other suggested web frameworks you can integrate Theo with are http://www.kitura.io[Kitura^] and http://perfect.org[Perfect^].

Theo has been available since Swift 1.2, and has followed the Swift versions since then. For the future we also plan to stay on top of the latest Swift versions. Theo interfaces Neo4j via the REST protocol, support for Bolt is absolutely a priority on our roadmap ahead.

We look forward to hearing what you create using Theo and Neo4j. Feel free to ask any developer questions on the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Online Community^].

[#theo-starter]
=== Getting started with Theo
After installing https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo^] in your project, you are ready to

[source, swift]
----
import Theo
----

Then you can instantiate your client like so

[source, swift]
----
let theo: Client = Client(baseURL: "hostname.com", user: "username", pass: "password")
----

create a node

[source, swift]
----
let node = Node()
let randomString: String = UUID().uuidString

node.setProp("propertyKey_1", propertyValue: "propertyValue_1" + randomString)
node.setProp("propertyKey_2", propertyValue: "propertyValue_2" + randomString)

theo.createNode(node, completionBlock: { (node, error) in
    print("new node \(node)")
})
----

fetch a node

[source, swift]
----
theo.fetchNode("IDToFetch", completionBlock: { (node, error) in    
    print("meta in success \(node!.meta) node \(node) error \(error)")
})
----

do a cypher query

[source, swift]
----
let cypherQuery: String = "MATCH (node1:Label1)-->(node2:Label2) WHERE node1.propertyA = {value} RETURN node2.propertyA, node2.propertyB"
let cypherParams: Dictionary<String, AnyObject> = ["value" : "someValue"]
		
theo.executeCypher(cypherQuery, params: cypherParams, completionBlock: { (cypher, error) in
    println("response from cypher \(cypher)")
})
----

or a transaction

[source, swift]
----
let createStatement: String = "CREATE ( bike:Bike { weight: 10 } ) CREATE ( frontWheel:Wheel { spokes: 3 } ) CREATE ( backWheel:Wheel { spokes: 32 } ) CREATE p1 = bike -[:HAS { position: 1 } ]-> frontWheel CREATE p2 = bike -[:HAS { position: 2 } ]-> backWheel RETURN bike, p1, p2"        
let resultDataContents: Array<String> = ["row", "graph"]
let statement: Dictionary <String, AnyObject> = ["statement" : createStatement, "resultDataContents" : resultDataContents]
let statements: Array<Dictionary <String, AnyObject>> = [statement]

theo.executeTransaction(statements, completionBlock: {(response, error) in
    print("response \(response) and error \(error?.description")
})
----

As you can see, it is very much how you would expect Swift code to read, and it integrates with Neo4j very much how you would expect a Neo4j integration to be. So no hard learning curves, meaning you can start being productive right away.

Happy coding!
