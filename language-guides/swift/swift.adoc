.Goals
[abstract]

If you are an iOS, macOS or Linux developer using Swift, this guide provides instructions for how to use the https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo] framework to interact with Neo4j. 

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

=== Neo4j for Swift Developers

Swift is a great language for writing iOS and macOS apps, and with the introduction of Swift 3.0, it has become a great language for writing server side applications as well. All of which are excellent places to use Neo4j.

==== Theo

https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo], the Swift framework for interfacing Neo4j, is now available in itâ€™s version 3.0.
It supports CRUD operations for nodes and relationships, cypher  and transactions.
It is available for iOS, macOS and Linux, using package managers such as the https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#swift-package-manager[Swift Package Manager], https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#cococapods[CocoaPods] and https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#carthage[Carthage], as well as a https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios#git-submodule[git submodule].

=== Getting started with Theo
After installing https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios[Theo] in your project, you are ready to

[source, swift]
----
import Theo
----

Then you can instantiate your client like so

[source, swift]
----
let theo: Client = Client(baseURL: "hostname.com", user: "username", pass: "password")
----

create a node

[source, swift]
----
let node = Node()
let randomString: String = UUID().uuidString

node.setProp("propertyKey_1", propertyValue: "propertyValue_1" + randomString)
node.setProp("propertyKey_2", propertyValue: "propertyValue_2" + randomString)

theo.createNode(node, completionBlock: { (node, error) in
    print("new node \(node)")
})
----

fetch a node

[source, swift]
----
theo.fetchNode("IDToFetch", completionBlock: { (node, error) in    
    print("meta in success \(node!.meta) node \(node) error \(error)")
})
----

do a cypher query

[source, swift]
----
let cyperQuery: String = "MATCH (node1:Label1)-->(node2:Label2) WHERE node1.propertyA = {value} RETURN node2.propertyA, node2.propertyB"
let cyperParams: Dictionary<String, AnyObject> = ["value" : "someValue"]
		
theo.executeCypher(cyperQuery, params: cyperParams, completionBlock: { (cypher, error) in
    println("response from cyper \(cypher)")
})
----

or a transaction

[source, swift]
----
let createStatement: String = "CREATE ( bike:Bike { weight: 10 } ) CREATE ( frontWheel:Wheel { spokes: 3 } ) CREATE ( backWheel:Wheel { spokes: 32 } ) CREATE p1 = bike -[:HAS { position: 1 } ]-> frontWheel CREATE p2 = bike -[:HAS { position: 2 } ]-> backWheel RETURN bike, p1, p2"        
let resultDataContents: Array<String> = ["row", "graph"]
let statement: Dictionary <String, AnyObject> = ["statement" : createStatement, "resultDataContents" : resultDataContents]
let statements: Array<Dictionary <String, AnyObject>> = [statement]

theo.executeTransaction(statements, completionBlock: {(response, error) in
    print("response \(response) and error \(error?.description")
})
----

As you can see, it is very much how you would expect Swift code to read, and it integrates with Neo4j very much how you would expect a Neo4j integration to be. So no hard learning curves, meaning you can start being productive right away. Happy coding
