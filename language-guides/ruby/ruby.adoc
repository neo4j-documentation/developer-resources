.Goals
[abstract]
This guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j using Ruby. It will introduce the different drivers and link to relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model. You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

=== Neo4j for Rubyists

There are three popular gems for Neo4j:


neography (**link:https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography[GitHub]**)::
  A thin wrapper for the REST API that also provides additional methods to simplify node and relationship CRUD. It is compatible with Neo4j Server 1.8 through 2.X.

neo4j-core (**link:https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core[GitHub]**)::
  A slightly heavier wrapper that provides a full Cypher DSL in addition to methods to simplify CRUD. It is compatible with Neo4j 2+ in both Server and Embedded modes.

neo4j (**link:https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j[GitHub]**)::
  An OGM based on the ideas of ActiveRecord that provides app-building tools that will make any Ruby on Rails user happy. It relies on neo4j-core and, as a result, is compatible with Neo4j 2+ in both Server and Embedded modes.

// end::intro[]

==== Feature Comparison

Each gem fills a different need, so the choice of a gem should be based on the plans for your app and its hosting. You may also want to review frequency of updates, versions of Neo4j supported, and size of the community. Here's a comparison chart of the these three gems to help make your decision.

[options="header",frame="topbot"]
|============================================
| Feature | neography | neo4j-core | neo4j
| Summary | Thin wrapper for the REST API. Fewest dependencies. | Provides simple communication with DB, Cypher DSL. | Full-featured ORM similar to ActiveRecord.
| Neo4j Embedded/Java API |  | Yes | Yes
| Neo4j Server | Yes | Yes | Yes
| Heroku-compatible | Yes | Yes | Yes 
| Cypher DSL |  | Yes | Yes + association chaining
| ActiveModel-complaint (Drop-in use with Ruby on Rails) |  |  | Yes
| Legacy Indexing Support | Yes |  | 
| Neo4j 1.X Support | Yes |  | 
| Neo4j 2.X Support | Yes | Yes | Yes
|============================================

All of the gems provide full support for Neo4j transactions.

=== Deployment Considerations

Very often, your gem choice may come down to how you want to deploy:

server::
  Using Ruby with a separate Neo4j Server over the HTTP API

embedded::
  Connecting directly to the Neo4j database files from within your Ruby process (this requires JRuby)

A separate Neo4j server is go-to choice for most developers, especially if they are used to other relational or NoSQL databases in frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. It allows you to have separate web and database servers and allows compatibility with popular PaaSes such as Heroku. If this sounds good to you, any of the popular gems are solid choices and you are free to consider whether you want a thin wrapper or the full framework experience.

Neo4j Embedded and JRuby is less common but offers blazing fast performance and access to our core Java API. The downside is that JRuby has its own configuration and compatibility demands and hosting a Java app can be difficult. Thankfully, modern app servers such as Torquebox and a strong community provide far more options and resources now than ever before. If this is right for you, the Neo4j-core and Neo4j gems will offer what you need.

=== Neography

Written by our own http://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi], Neography feels very familiar if you’re already used to Neo4j: it’s designed as a thin wrapper above our database APIs.

It supports the Neo4j transactional Cypher endpoint as well as the existing REST API and even supports Neo4j-Spatial.

* https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography/wiki[Documentation]
* http://maxdemarzi.com/category/neography/[Many blog posts with examples]

Compared to Neo4j-core, it is notable for its smaller footprint, fewer dependencies, and support for extensions to the REST API. It is the perfect choice for basic communication with a database or as a backend for a custom OGM.

[source,ruby]
----
neo = Neography::Rest.new("http://neo4j:swordfish@localhost:7474")

neo.execute_query("MATCH (person:Person) RETURN person LIMIT 10")

node = neo.create_node("age" => 31, "name" => "Max")
----

=== Neo4j-core and Neo4j (collectively the Neo4j.rb project)

https://github.com/andreasronge[Andreas Ronge] is one of our Swedish friends from Malmö and started writing his canonical Neo4j Ruby driver since before we hit 1.0.

https://github.com/cheerfulstoic[Brian Underwood] and https://github.com/subvertallchris[Chris Grigg] joined the project and together released http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-rb-3-0-released/[version 3.0] in September 2014. Neo4j.rb 3.0 won a Neo4j Graphie award for "Best Community Contribution" at the 2014 GraphConnect Conference.

Since then Brian and Chris have continued the effort to build new features, improve the API, and increase performance.  In addition to working actively on the http://neo4jrb.io/[Neo4jrb project], Brian and Chris are very active community members, you can find them online on Stack Overflow and Twitter as well as in person at meetups and Neo4j events.

Both projects support accessing Neo4j in embedded mode via JRuby and server mode via MRI.

==== Neo4j-core

Similar to Neography, Neo4j-core is a gem that provides low-level communication to a Neo4j server. In addition to basic database communicaton and node/relationship CRUD, Neo4j-core provides strong support for Neo4j 2.0's schema indexes, constraints, labels, and a strong Cypher DSL.

How to get running:

[source,ruby]
----
session = Neo4j::Session.open(:server_db,
                              "http://neo4j:your-password@localhost:7474")

session.query("MATCH (person:Person) RETURN person LIMIT 10")


# alternatively you can use the query chaining API:
session.query.match(person: :Person).return(:person).limit(10).to_a
----


==== Neo4j

The neo4j gem uses neo4j-core as an API to connect to the server and provides an ActiveRecord-like experience for use in frameworks. It adds modules allowing the creation of models that look and feel very similar to those found in vanilla Ruby on Rails. The gem builds on Neo4j-core's foundation to streamline all aspects of node and relationship CRUD and provides an extremely advanced, intuitive, flexible DSL for generating Cypher.

How to get running:

[source,ruby]
----
# See the documentation for setup instructions

class Person
  include Neo4j::ActiveNode

  property :name

  has_many :out, :books, type: :OWNS_BOOK
  has_many :both, :friends, type: :HAS_FRIEND
end

person = Person.find_by(name: 'Jim')

# Get the books owned by Jim's friends:
person.friends.books.to_a
