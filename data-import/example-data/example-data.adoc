.Goals
[abstract]
There's lots of example datasets for Neo4j.
This guide outlines some of them.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be comfortable installing and importing data into Neo4j.

[role=expertise]

[#data-sets]
== Data Sets

We want to cover data sets from the different domains.
For each of the data sets we want to provide a description, the graph model and some use-case queries.

[NOTE]
This is work in progress, so some data sets might not be updated with that information yet.

[TIP]
Have fun, and send us feedback to feedback@neo4j.com or raise https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/developer/issues[an issue] if something doesn't work as expected.

[#load-data-source]
== Loading Data from Source

The most reliable way to get a dataset into Neo4j is to import it from the raw sources.
Then you are independent of database and store-versions, which you otherwise have to upgrade.
That's why we provided raw data (CSV, JSON, XML) for many of the data sets, accompanied by import scripts.

You would import the data using a command-line client like `neo4j-shell` or https://github.com/nicolewhite/cycli[CyCli] a modern, colorful Neo4j client, which understands the same file format.

[source, shell]
----
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-shell -file import-file.cypher

# or

cycli -f import-file.cypher
----

// todo screenshot cycli
// todo import screencast

[#load-db-copy]
== Using a copy of a Neo4j database

Other data sets are provided as compressed copy (zip) of a Neo4j datastore.
You can find the datastore files in `$NEO4J_HOME/data/databases/[graph.db]` or in the directory you selected at startup.
Please stop your Neo4j server and uncompress the store-files into the appropriate directory.

[WARNING]
For some data sets the Neo4j version they were built with might be older than your Neo4j version.
Then you might need to configure Neo4j to upgrade your database automatically, by setting `dbms.allow_upgrade=true` in `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.config`

You can also run neo4j-shell on the extracted directory directly:

[source, shell]
----
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-shell -path /path/to/graph.db
----

// TODO CSV Datasets !!
[#fun-datasets]
== Pop Culture Datasets

s3cmd ls s3://example-data.neo4j.org/3.0-datasets/ | awk '{ split($4,a,"/");print "| a[5] | desc                       | src                     | http://" a[3] "/" a[4] "/" a[5] "[" a[5] " (" int($3/1024/1024) "MB)]"}'
