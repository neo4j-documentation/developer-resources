.Goals
[abstract]
This guide explains the basic concepts of Cypher, Neo4j's query language.
You should be able to read and understand Cypher queries after finishing this guide.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have familiarized yourself with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[Graph Databases] and the link:/developer/get-started/graph-database#property-graph[Property Graph Model].

== About Cypher

Cypher is a declarative, SQL-inspired language for describing patterns in graphs visually using an ascii-art syntax.

It allows us to state *what* we want to select, insert, update or delete from our graph data without requiring us to describe exactly *how* to do it.

=== Nodes

Cypher uses ASCII-Art to represent patterns.
We surround nodes with parentheses which look like circles, e.g. `(node)`.
If we later want to refer to the node, we'll give it an variable like `(p)` for person or `(t)` for thing.
In real-world queries, we'll probably use longer, more expressive variable names like `(person)` or `(thing)`.
If the node is not relevant to your question, you can also use empty parentheses `()`.

[TIP]
Usually, the relevant *labels* of the node are provided to distinguish between entities and optimize execution, like `(p:Person)`.

We might use a pattern like `+(person:Person)-->(thing:Thing)+` so we can refer to them later, for example, to access properties like `person.name` and `thing.quality`.

The more general structure is:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (node:Label) RETURN node.property

MATCH (node1:Label1)-->(node2:Label2)
WHERE node1.propertyA = {value}
RETURN node2.propertyA, node2.propertyB
----

[WARNING]
Please note that _node-labels_, _relationship-types_ and _property-names_ are *case-sensitive* in Cypher.
All the other clauses, keywords and functions are not, but should be cased consistently according to the style used here.

=== Relationships

To fully utilize the power of our graph database we want to express more complex patterns between our nodes.
Relationships are basically an arrow `+-->+` between two nodes.
Additional information can be placed in square brackets inside of the arrow.

This can be

* relationship-types like `+-[:KNOWS|:LIKE]->+`
* a variable name `+-[rel:KNOWS]->+` before the colon
* additional properties `+-[{since:2010}]->+`
* structural information for paths of variable length `+-[:KNOWS*..4]->+`

To access information about a relationship, we can assign it a variable, for later reference.
It is placed in front of the colon `+-[rel:KNOWS]->+` or stands alone `+-[rel]->+`.

[WARNING] If you forget the colon in front of a relationship-type, like this `+-[KNOWS]->+` it does represent a variable and the relationship has *no* relationship-type declared.

General Syntax:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n1:Label1)-[rel:TYPE]->(n2:Label2)
WHERE rel.property > {value}
RETURN rel.property, type(rel)
----

=== Patterns

Nodes and relationship expressions are the building blocks for more complex patterns.
Patterns can be written continously or separated with commas.
You can refer to variables declared earlier or introduce new ones.

* friend-of-a-friend `+(user)-[:KNOWS]-(friend)-[:KNOWS]-(foaf)+`
* shortest path: `+path = shortestPath( (user)-[:KNOWS*..5]-(other) )+`
* collaborative filtering `+(user)-[:PURCHASED]->(product)<-[:PURCHASED]-()-[:PURCHASED]->(otherProduct)+`
* tree navigation `+(root)<-[:PARENT*]-(leaf:Category)-[:ITEM]->(data:Product)+`

[TIP]
Patterns can be used to MATCH and CREATE data, but also (evaluating to a list of paths) in expressions, predicates and results.
