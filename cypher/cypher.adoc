- - -
Cypher is Neo4j's open graph query language.
Cypher's syntax provides a familiar way to match patterns of nodes and relationships in the graph.

These developer guides and tutorials show you how to query Neo4j using Cypher.

Here is a simple example of a cypher query (cast of movies starting with "T")

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE movie.title STARTS WITH "T"
RETURN movie.title as title, collect(actor.name) as cast
ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 10;
----

If you're be able to read and understand it without any training, we achieved our goal.

[[intro]]
== Introduction to Cypher
- - -
These guides explain the basic concepts of Cypher, including how to create and query data.
You should be able to read, understand and write Cypher queries after completing them.

[TIP]
In Neo4j Cypher statements are executed via a *fast binary protocol*, using our link:/developer-resources/language-guides#bolt-drivers[officially supported drivers].
A *cost based optimizer* uses real-time database statistics to run your statements as efficiently as possible.
You can always access the underlying query-plans using the `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` prefixes.

== The openCypher Project
- - -

Since October 2015 the http://openCypher.org[openCypher,_blank] project aims to provide an open grammar, language specification, technical compatibility kit and reference implementation of parser, planner and runtime for Cypher.

It is backed by several companies in the database space and allows implementors of databases and clients to freely benefit, use from and contribute to the development of the open Cypher language.


[[recommendation]]
== Build a Recommendation Engine
- - -

This guide explains how to leverage connections in your data to gather insights and start recommending currently unrelated but relevant facts to your nodes in focus.

== Cypher Reference Card
- - -
The {manual}/cypher-refcard/[*Cypher Reference Card*] is an invaluable resource for each Neo4j user.
It details every clause, function and keyword in Cypher with short examples to help you understand the concepts.
You should keep a link:/docs/pdf/neo4j-cypher-refcard-stable.pdf[printed variant] handy at all times.
