.Goals
[abstract]
This guide explains how to use, create and deploy user defined procedures and functions, the extension mechanism of Cypher, Neo4j's query language.
It also covers existing, widely used procedure libraries

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have learned to read and write statements in link:/developer/cypher/cypher-query-language[Cypher] and seen the need for additional capabilities.

[#cypher-extension]
== Extending Cypher

Cypher is a quite powerful and expressive language, with first class graph pattern and collection support.

But sometimes you need to do more than it currently offers, like additional graph algorithms, parallelization or custom conversions.

That's why the ability to extend Cypher with User Defined Procedures and Functions was added to the Neo4j 3.0 and 3.1 releases.
But not only users, even Neo4j itself provides and utilizes custom procedures.
Many of the monitoring, introspection and security features exposed by Neo4j-Browser are implemented using procedures.

[#procedures-functions]
== What are Procedures and Functions?

* Functions are simple computations / conversions and return a single value
* Functions can be used in any expression or predicate

* Procedures are more complex operations and generate streams of results.
* Procedures must be used within the `CALL` clause and `YIELD` their result columns
* They can generate, fetch or compute data to make it available to later processing steps in your Cypher query

[#cypher-list-extension]
== Listing & Using Functions and Procedures

There are a {opsmanual}/reference/procedures/[number of built in procedures^], two of which are used to list available functions and procedures.

Run the following statements along to get a hang of the usage and see their results.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures() 
----

Call `dbms.functions()` to list functions.

Each procedure returns one or more columns of data.
With `yield` these columns can be selected and also aliased and are then available in your Cypher statement.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures() 
YIELD name, signature, description as text
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'db.'
RETURN * ORDER BY name ASC
----

Of course you can also process the result columns with other Cypher clauses. 
Here we group them by package.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name, signature, description
WITH split(name,".") AS parts
RETURN parts[0..-1] AS package,  count(*) AS count,
       collect(parts[-1]) AS names
ORDER BY count DESC
----

[options=header]
|===
|package             |count  |names
|["dbms","security"] |16     |["activateUser","addRoleToUser","changePassword",....]     
|["apoc","refactor"] |11     |["categorize","cloneNodes","from"....]                     
|["apoc","load"]     |9      |["csv","driver","jdbc","jdbcParams","json","jsoe"]         
|["db"]              |9      |["awaitIndex","constraints","indexes","labels",..,"schema"]
|["dbms"]            |9      |["components","functions","queries","procedures",...]      
|===

As of Neo4j 3.1, all functions available are directly part of the Cypher implementation, so User Defined Functions would only come from installed libraries.

You can take any procedure library and deploy it to your server to make additional procedures and functions available.

Please also have a look at the link:/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/procedures-and-functions/introduction/[procedure section in the Neo4j Manual^].

[#deploy-extension]
== Deploying Procedures & Functions

If you built your own procedures or downloaded them from an community project, they are packaged in a jar-file.
You can copy that file into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory of your Neo4j server and restart.

[WARNING] 
*A word of caution.*
As procedures and functions use the low level Java API they can access all Neo4j internals as well as the file system and machine. 
That's why you should know which procedures you deploy and why. 
Only install procedures from trusted sources. 
If they are open source, check their source-code and best build them yourself.

[#procedure-function-gallery]
== Procedure and Function Gallery

In our link:../procedures-gallery[procedure and functions gallery] we describe some of the impressive procedure libraries built by our community.
Check it out to see what's already there.
Many of your needs will already be covered by those, for example:

* graph algorithms
* index operations
* database/api integration
* graph refactorings
* import and export
* spatial index lookup
* rdf import and export
* and many more

Here are two cool examples of what you can do:

A procedure to load data from another database:

[source,cypher]
-----
WITH "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/northwind?user=root" as url
CALL apoc.load.jdbc(url,"products") YIELD row
RETURN row 
ORDER BY row.UnitPrice DESC
LIMIT 20
-----

Functions to format and parse timestamps of different resolutions:

[source,cypher]
----
RETURN apoc.date.format(timestamp()) as time, 
       apoc.date.format(timestamp(),'ms','yyyy-MM-dd') as date,
       apoc.date.parse('13.01.1975','s','dd.MM.yyyy') as unixtime, 
       apoc.date.parse('2017-01-05 13:03:07') as millis
----

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|time                 |date        |unixtime  |millis
|"2017-01-05 13:06:39"|"2017-01-05"|158803200 |1483621387000

[#custom-extension]
== Developing your own Procedures and Functions

// === Writing your first Function

You can find details on writing and testing procedures in the link:/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/procedures-and-functions/introduction/[Neo4j Manual^].

There is even an https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-procedure-template[example GitHub repository] with detailed documentation and comments that you can clone directly and use as a starting point.

Here are just some initial tips:

User-defined functions are simpler, so let's start with them:

* `@UserFunction` are annotated, public Java methods in a class
* their default name is package-name.method-name
* they return a single value
* are read only

User defined procedures are similar:

* `@Procedure` annotated, Java methods
* with an additional `mode` attribute (`READ, WRITE, DBMS`)
* return a Java 8 `Stream` of simple objects with `public` fields
* these fields names are turned into result columns available for `YIELD`

These things are valid for both:

* take `@Name` annotated parameters (with optional default values)
* can use an injected `@Context public GraphDatabaseService`
* run within transaction of the Cypher statement
* supported types for parameters and results are: `Long, Double, Boolean, String, Node, Relationship, Path, Object`

////
User-defined functions are simpler, so let's look at one here:

* `@UserFunction` annotated, named Java Methods
** default name is `class package + "." +  method-name`
* take `@Name`'ed parameters (with optional default values)
* return a single value
* are read only
* can use `@Context` injected `GraphDatabaseService` etc
* run within Transaction of the Cypher Statement

.simple user defined `create.uuid` function in Java
[source,java]
----
@UserFunction("create.uuid")
@Description("creates an UUID (universally unique id)")
public String uuid() {
   return UUID.randomUUID().toString();
}
----
////

////
cp $GROOVY_HOME/lib/groovy-2.*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/
$GROOVY_HOME/groovyc function.groovy && jar cf $NEO4J_HOME/plugins/uuid.jar UDF.class

@Grab(value="org.neo4j:neo4j:3.1.0-BETA1",initClass=false)

class UDF {
   @UserFunction("create.uuid")
   @Description("creates an UUID")
   def String uuid() { UUID.randomUUID().toString() }
}
////

////
.use the function like this
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (p:Person {id: create.uuid(), name:{name}})
----

=== Testing the Function

The Neo4j testing library `neo4j-harness` enables you to spin up a Neo4j server, provide fixtures for data setup and register your functions and procedures.

You then call and test test the function via the bolt - `neo4j-java-driver`.

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public Neo4jRule neo4j = new Neo4jRule()
                         .withFunction( UUIDs.class );
...

try( Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( neo4j.boltURI() , config ) {
    Session session = driver.session();
    String uuid = session.run("RETURN create.uuid() AS uuid")
                         .single().get( 0 ).asString();
    assertThat( uuid,....);
}
----

=== Writing a Procedure

User defined procedures are similar:

* `@Procedure` annotated, Java methods
* with an additional `mode` attribute (`Read, Write, Dbms`)
* return a `Stream` of value objects (DTO) with `public` fields
* value object fields are turned into result columns to be `YIELD`ed

.Expose dijkstra algoritm from the Java API to Cypher
[source,java]
----
@Procedure(mode = Write)
@Description("apoc.algo.dijkstra(startNode, endNode, 'KNOWS', 'distance') YIELD path," +
       " weight - run dijkstra with relationship property name as cost function")
public Stream<WeightedPathResult> dijkstra(
       @Name("startNode") Node startNode,
       @Name("endNode") Node endNode,
       @Name("type") String type,
       @Name("costProperty") String costProperty) {


   PathFinder<WeightedPath> algo = GraphAlgoFactory.dijkstra(
           PathExpanders.forType(RelationshipType.withName(type)),
           costProperty);
   Iterable<WeightedPath> allPaths = algo.findAllPaths(startNode, endNode);
   return Iterables.asCollection(allPaths).stream()
           .map(WeightedPathResult::new);
}

public static class WeightedPathResult {
   public final Path path;
   public final double weight;
   public WeightedPathResult(WeightedPath wp) { this.path = wp; this.weight = wp.weight(); }
}
----

Use a build tool (like maven, gradle, ant) to package your code into a jar-file and copy that into `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins`
Make sure required dependencies are added as well, either to your jar or the plugins directory.
