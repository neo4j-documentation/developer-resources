=== Disk Space

Nodes occupy 14B of space, relationships occupy 31B of space and properties occupy 41B of space.

An example disk space calculation is:

10,000    Nodes x 14B = 140kB
1,000,000 Rels  x 33B = 31.5MB
2,010,000 Props x 41B = 78.6MB

Total  is 110.2MB

=== Low Level Cache

The low level cache requirements are the same as disk space.

=== Optimizing

In optimizing a graph database solution for performance, we should bear in mind the following guidelines:

* We should utilize the filesystem cache as much as possible; if possible, we should map our store files in their entirety into this cache
* We should tune the JVM heap and keep an eye on GC behaviors
* We should consider using fast disks—SSDs or enterprise flash hardware—to bring up the bottom line when disk access becomes inevitable

=== Performance Optimization
There are three areas in which we can optimize for performance:

* Increase the object cache (from 2 GB, all the way up to 200 GB or more in exceptional circumstances)
* Increase the percentage of the store mapped into the filesystem cache
* Invest in faster disks: SSDs or enterprise flash hardware
