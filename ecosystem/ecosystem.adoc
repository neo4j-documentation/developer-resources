=== Neo4j Ecosystem

Neo4j is a graph database management system, it comes with an implementation of the database, a server and a web interface.
There are APIs, documentation and examples for operations, certain use-cases and applications.

To make it easy to integrate Neo4j into a system infrastructure there are many more aspects to be addressed.
Those additional aspects cover many different areas: drivers, visualization, ETL and BI tools, integration platforms, development tools and additional frameworks and libraries on top of Neo4j that allow you to address certain problems faster and with less effort.

Being an open source database, we benefit from users and contributors in our ecosystem that
