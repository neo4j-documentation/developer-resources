.Goals
[abstract]
This guide highlights the different options for setting up Neo4j in the cloud.
It includes setting up Neo4j on EC2 on AWS, explain the setup on Azure, and introduce the different Neo4j cloud-hosting partners.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to run and operate Neo4j locally. 
Knowledge of remote drivers to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database. 
For self-service hosting you should bring along enough sysops experience that a Linux system doesn't freak you out.

=== Hosting on AWS / EC2

////
We provide an https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-puppet/blob/master/README.CLOUDFORMATION.md[*EC2 Cloud Formation Template*] that allows you to quickly provision an appropriate instance and install and set-up Neo4j on that machine.

This template creates a complete Neo4j installation, including Amazon AWS server, fixed IP address and backup storage. 
It's intended to help application developers get up and running quickly with Neo4j without in-depth experience of Linux servers, AWS, or installing databases like Neo4j.


If you are proficient at setting up AWS instances, you can also install Neo4j on any provisioned Linux instance

[NOTE]
We used to provide a cloud formation template but it has not been maintained for a while, so we chose to remove it.

Setting up Neo4j on any Debian or Ubuntu system should be pretty straightforward by following the instructions on http://debian.neo4j.org[our Debian Repository].

For other Linux distributions, just download the http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j binary] and unzip and start it.
The binary distribution also provides scripts to install Neo4j as a service.

=== Windows Azure

It gets easier to deploy Neo4j Server on Azure every day, so here you can find some step-by-step instructions and hints on how to achieve that.

Neo4j installation on Windows Azure can be provisioned through the VMDepot Image or by provisioning Linux instances and then running any of the provisioning scripts you'd like.

=== Neo4j with Docker

http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on your machine.
Docker images are pre-build in layers from configuration of services one of which would be Neo4j.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, no time-consuming boot required.

It is pretty easy to create a Neo4j image yourself, just any base linux container with a JDK is good enough.
Just add Neo4j on top and you're done. 

There are already a number of https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=neo4j[Docker Neo4j images] available on Docker Hub.

Make sure when running the docker image to expose the Neo4j port `7474` and provide the database directory as external volume. E.g.

`docker run –rm -i -t -d –privileged -v /home/user/neo4jdata:/var/lib/neo4j/data -p 7474:7474 tpires/neo4j`

Some of the more widely used images:

* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kbastani/docker-neo4j/[latest Neo4j by Kenny Bastani]

=== Neo4j Cloud Hosting Providers

There are a number of Neo4j partners that provide hosting of Neo4j instances in the cloud. 
If you provision databases via their offering, you enter a contract with those partners, not with Neo Technology.
