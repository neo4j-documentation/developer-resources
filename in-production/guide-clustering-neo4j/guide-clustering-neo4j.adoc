.Goals
[abstract]
This guide describes how to configure a high availability cluster of Neo4j Enterprise.
It includes topics such as data synchronization, mending procedures, configuring an arbiter, and slave-only mode configuration.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to link:/download[download] and install Neo4j on your system.
If you are a developer, you should be accustomed to the graph data model and have written your Neo4j application.
A sound understanding of Neo4j's APIs, link:../guide-performance-tuning[tuning], security, and upgrade aspects will help you set up a stable cluster.

[#neo4j-cluster]
== Data Synchronization between master and slaves

The Neo4j High Availability Cluster is a fault tolerant, full master-slave replication setup.
Any data (graph or index) created on the master is propagated to the slaves depending on the settings of the master `ha.tx_push_factor` (number of slaves to actively push to during commit) and slaves `ha.pull_interval` (frequency of pulling updates from the master).

[#cluster-config]
== Configuring a Two-Slave Cluster with an Arbiter

There's a {opsmanual}/tutorial/highly-available-cluster/[step-by-step tutorial for setting up a HA cluster].
For a two-node cluster, you'll actually want to run three separate machines, and use the Neo4j arbiter on the third.
Details on the arbiter are available in the {opsmanual}/clustering/high-availability/arbiter-instances/[Neo4j Operations Manual].
The configuration for the arbiter is identical to that of a regular instance, with the exception of anything relating to the actual graph database itself (since an arbiter doesn't hold any data).

The `ha.initial_hosts` property should be the same on all the instances, including the arbiter.
The arbiter should have a unique `ha.server_id` (`3` is fine).

[#follow-server]
=== Setting a Server in Slave-Only Mode

// what is the new link?
See the {opsmanual}/clustering/high-availability/configuration/[documentation] on `ha.slave_only`.

You might want to configure a machine with that setting if it’s acting as a reporting instance but you need to make sure that two members don’t have that setting, or you won’t have any failover in the cluster.

[#backup-cluster]
== Backing Up a Cluster Server

Neo4j Server must be configured to run a backup service.
This is enabled via the configuration parameter `online_backup_enabled`, and is enabled by default.
The interface and port the backup service listens on is configured via the parameter `online_backup_server` and defaults to the `loopback` interface and port `6362`.
It is typical to reconfigure this to listen on an external interface, by setting `online_backup_server=<my-host-ip-address>:6362`.
It can also be configured to listen on all interfaces by setting `online_backup_server=0.0.0.0:6362`.

It is best to use the back tool with the command line `./bin/neo4j-backup -host 192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup`, which will backup the store from that specific host even if that host is running in a cluster.

[#mend-leader]
== Mending Procedure for Master

* Shut down all members of the cluster and stop any load against the cluster
* On the master instance, copy the `data/graph.db` folder as a backup
* Modify neo4j-server.properties, setting the `org.neo4j.server.database.mode` to STANDALONE`
* Start the database and, once it's running, stop it again (this is to ensure he database is cleanly shut down)
* Remove all files named `nioneo_logical.log.vXX` in `data/graph.db`, being careful not to remove any files without the "`v`", like `nioneo_logical.log.1` or `nioneo_logical.log.active`
* Start the server and use either neo4j-shell or the neo4j browser to issue the following two queries:

. First query. Note the id returned here

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (n) RETURN id(n)
----

. Second query. Use the id returned from the previous query

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) WHERE id(n) = <your node id> DELETE n
----

* Stop the server
* Set org.neo4j.server.database.mode to HA
* Start the server

[#follower-mend]
== Mending Procedure for Slaves

* On each slave, remove the `data/graph.db` folder
* Start the slave, and watch `data/graph.db` for it to copy the store from the master
* Once copying is done, move to do the same thing on the second slave
