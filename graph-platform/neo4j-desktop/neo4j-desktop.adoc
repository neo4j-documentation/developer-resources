[#install-neo4j-desktop]
If you haven't already, link:/download/[download^] Neo4j.
Instructions for setting up the application will be shown after you click the download.

****
[NOTE]
Your activation key will be displayed at the top of the instruction page.
We recommend copying it to a safe place, just in case.
If lost, another will need to be requested by contacting Neo4j.
****

Using the provided instructions, follow Step 1 to install and start the Neo4j Desktop application.
Step 2 on the download page instructions shows you how to set up your first project and database and how to open the Neo4j in the browser, but we want to cover this step in more detail.

[#desktop-activate]
== Opening Neo4j Desktop for the First Time

If you are opening Neo4j Desktop for the first time, it should ask you to register the software with an activation key.
This activation key is generated when you first download Neo4j Desktop and will be displayed on the download confirmation page.
While we can copy it to the clipboard and paste it into the provided input in Neo4j Desktop, we also recommend copying it to a safe place as a backup (local file, password vault, or another method).

image::{img}desktop_registration_may2020.jpg[link="{img}desktop_registration_may2020.jpg",float="right"]

Copy this activation key into the Software registration form and click Activate to continue.

As a new user to Neo4j Desktop, you will be greeted with a new sample database containing https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/movies[Movies and Actors^].

image::{img}first_graph_experience.png[link="{img}first_graph_experience.png",float="right"]

Clicking the Browser Guide link for the Sample database will open up the Neo4j Browser with a Browser Guide that will guide you through your first queries on this Neo4j database.

The sample database is created using a randomly generated password, which is stored within Neo4j Desktop and used by Neo4j Browser to authenticate against the database.
You can reset this password in the Administration tab on the Manage screen.

[#desktop-navigate]
== Navigation

The menu along the left side of Neo4j Desktop shows high-level icons for projects, graph applications, settings, activation keys, and Neo4j info.
At the top, the folder with a bookmark (image:{img}projects_icon.jpg[width=20]) shows the list of projects you have created.

=== Creating and Deleting a Project

To create a new project, simply click `+ New` at the right of the `Projects` menu.
The app will add a row in the menu for a project named `Project`.
You can change the name by clicking on the pencil icon that appears when you hover on the project name in the right pane.
To remove the project, hover over the `Project` row in the projects menu and click the trash bin icon that appears on the right side (image:{img}desktop_delete_proj_icon.jpg[width=20]).

image::{img}deleting_a_project.jpg[link="{img}deleting_a_project.jpg",float="right"]

=== Settings

Application settings can be modified or viewed by clicking the gear towards the bottom of the left-side menu in Neo4j Desktop (image:{img}settings_icon.jpg[width=20]).
You can modify any of these settings at any time.

The first block is for privacy settings where you can adjust what data is sent back to Neo4j for assistance and future improvements.
The next two sections are where you can configure a proxy or run Neo4j Desktop in offline mode.

****
[NOTE]
We do not recommend running Neo4j Desktop in offline mode unless required by your company.
Offline mode restricts some usage capabilities.
****

Under `Neo4j Distributions` section of the settings, it shows which versions of the database are used in your projects (if any) and lists the currently set up projects and databases.

The last section on `Developer Tools` is to add and integrate graph apps with Neo4j.
You can also access the javascript console of an application for debugging and error reporting through the developer tools.

=== Profile and About

The certificate icon (image:{img}activation_keys_icon.jpg[width=20]) shows the licenses that are attached to this installation in Neo4j Desktop, which includes activation of Desktop itself along with any graph app licenses.

The bottom icon (image:{img}neo4j_icon.jpg[width=20]) is information about Neo4j itself and includes links to the main company website, as well as release and license information.

[#desktop-create-db]
== Creating a graph database

From the Projects icon on the left-side menu, choose (or create) a project.
A panel will display on the right to show the databases in your project and the plugins available or installed.

To create a database, click in the dotted square that says `Add Graph`.
Then click the kbd:[Create a Local Graph] button.
Next, you will type in a name for your database set a password.
You can also choose a specific version of Neo4j (the default is latest version).
A small icon next to each version number in the dropdown menu will show which versions have been downloaded already.
Once the info is filled in, then click kbd:[Create].
It may take a few minutes to download the version and actually create the database.

****
[NOTE]
If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking the three dots to the top right of the Database card, clicking Manage, and navigating to the Administration tab.
****

You have now created your own graph database!
Now we will walk through some tools to interact with the database and data.

image::{img}db_section_instance.jpg[link="{img}db_section_instance.jpg",role="popup-link"]

The kbd:[Start] button in the bottom right hand corner of each database card will Start the database.
Once started, there will be a button in the bottom right hand corner to Stop the database.

Once a database has been started, the Open button in the bottom left hand corner of the card will be enabled.
Clicking Open will open link:/developer/neo4j-browser/[Neo4j Browser] and connect to the active database.
Next to the Open button is a dropdown menu which will allow you to open up a list of link:/developer/graph-app-development[Graph Apps].

[[desktop-manage-db]]
== Managing a database

To manage a database, click the three-dots icon in the top right hand of the card and click kbd:[Manage].

image::{img}manage_db_pane.jpg[link="{img}manage_db_pane.jpg",role="popup-link"]

At the top of the screen, you will see the database name and an icon to signify its status.
Directly underneath are three buttons to Start, Stop, or Restart the database.

image::{img}status_buttons.jpg[link="{img}status_buttons.jpg",role="popup-link"]

The kbd:[Open Folder] button will open up the root folder for this database.
The arrow icon to the right of this button will allow you to open up additional folders related to this database, for example the Plugins or Logs folders.

image::{img}open_folder.jpg[link="{img}open_folder.jpg",role="popup-link"]

The kbd:[Open Terminal] button will open up a new terminal window in the root folder of the database.

Below these buttons are several tabs for information and settings.

The `Details` tab shows the description, version, and the status of your database along with some statistics for the database.
When the database is running, it will also show port numbers and addresses needed to interact with the database (screenshot below).

image::{img}db_details.jpg[link="{img}db_details.jpg",role="popup-link"]

The `Logs` tab will show all of the streaming log output from the database.

The `Settings` tab displays the configuration values for the database.
These can be changed, if needed.
Once changes are made, you can apply them, and Desktop will offer to restart the database (necessary for changes to take effect).

****
[NOTE]
You can also search the settings in this tab by using kbd:[Ctrl+F] / kbd:[Cmd+F] (Mac).
****

On the `Plugins` tab, you can see what plugins are available (or you have installed) to use with Neo4j.
Currently, Neo4j Desktop has plugins for APOC, GraphQL, and Graph Algorithms.
Short descriptions of each are shown in the Neo4j Desktop pane.
To add these functionalities, simply click kbd:[Install and Restart] for the plugin.

The `Upgrade` tab shows the list of all Neo4j versions, as well as the version this instance is currently running.
To change the version, choose one from the list and click kbd:[Upgrade to this version] in the right pane.

The last tab is `Administration`.
This tab just allows you to set a new password for your database.
