Each of the elements listed below was designed to fill a business or technical need in the image above.
We continue to improve the different perspectives from which to view data, as well as capabilities of the products themselves.

Detailed information and walkthroughs are covered in more detail in subsequent pages of this section, but if you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out through the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Online Community^]!

== Neo4j Integration Tools

Neo4j also has a variety of extension libraries and developer tools that can be added to existing products to enhance functionality.
Some of these projects have been adopted by our link:/labs/[Neo4j Labs^] team to help developers integrate with other innovative tools and libraries.

Tutorials and other specific information for some of these is included in this section.
Other non-Neo4j Labs extensions will be covered in the link:/developer/integration/[Extensions & Integrations] section of these guides.
