.Goals
[abstract]
This course provides an overview on everything that you need to build a Neo4j application with the link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby programming language^].
Ruby on Rails and Sinatra examples are given but any web framework (or lack thereof) can be used.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have Ruby installed on your system.
Some experience with Ruby and/or Rails is suggested.

[#ruby-course]
Let's say you would like to write a web application to track entities for yourself or your organization.
Being a good link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY^] programmer you might decide that what you want is an _asset portal_: an application which gives you an GUI for browsing and editing entities while also making it easy to define new assets.
This guide will show you how you might start creating such an application using Ruby on Rails and Neo4j.

[#neo4j-ruby]
== Why Neo4j?

Neo4j is the world's most popular _graph database_.
This offers a number of advantages:

 * Neo4j provides a schemaless representation of both entities and relationships between entities.
 * Relationships between entities are *traversed* rather than *joined*.
 Traversals explore the local subgraph meaning that query times stay the same as your database grows.
 * Because of the traversal paradigm we think in terms of the complex relationships in our data without worrying as much how to model it

Rubyists generally prefer tools which are developer friendly and which don't bother you with details until it's neccessary.
Neo4j makes it easy to create nodes and relationships in whatever way seems most natural, but you can also change the structure of your database with a query.

[#intro-neo4j]
== Introduction to Neo4j

Connected information is everywhere in our world.
Neo4j was built to efficiently store, handle, and query highly-connected elements in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model, you can represent your real-world, variably-structured information without a loss of fidelity.
The property graph model is easy to understand and handle, especially for object-oriented and relational developers.

[role="pull-right"]
--
image::{img}simple_graph.png[]
--

The property graph model consists of:

**Nodes**, which have:

 * _properties_: schemaless key/value pairs
 * _labels_: describe and group nodes much like tables group rows, but nodes can have multiple labels

**Relationships**, which connect two nodes directionally and have:

 * _properties_: schemaless key/value pairs
 * A _type_: gives a description of how it connects the two nodes

While relationships are directional, querying relationships in either direction has no associated performance cost.

=== Cypher

Cypher is Neo4j's built-in query language.
Cypher queries look like the following code block:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]->(f:Fruit)
RETURN p, f.name
----

The `MATCH` clause is the most common starting point for Cypher queries.
It defines a pattern for which to search and returns one result per match.
For example, we might get the following two matches:

image:{img}cypher_match_1.png[width=49%]
image:{img}cypher_match_2.png[width=49%]

With the `RETURN` clause, we would end up returning a table such as:

.Result of Cypher query
[width="99%", options="header"]
|=============================
| p                | f.name
| {name: "Denise"} | "Mango"
| {name: "Denise"} | "Banana"
|=============================

Here, you see we can return entire entities in our database rather than just properties.
This might be returned as a `Hash` in Ruby, though by default in the Neo4j.rb gems these are wrapped in an object.

This is very handy, but it would also be nice to avoid the duplication of our `Person` node.
You can perform the same match but instead use the `collect` function to aggregate the values:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]->(f:Fruit)
RETURN p, collect(f.name)
----

.Result of Cypher aggregation query
[width="99%", options="header"]
|=============================
| p                | f.name
| {name: "Denise"} | ["Mango", "Banana"]
|=============================

While it's possible to get started using the Neo4j.rb without learning Cypher, it is a very powerful way to query a Neo4j database and is worth learning.
Also, since the Neo4j.rb project works by making Cypher queries to Neo4j it is good to understand Cypher as your queries get more complex.
There is a link:/developer/cypher[Cypher tutorial] if you would like to learn more.

[#rb-project]
== Neo4j in Ruby

For this guide, we will be using the Neo4j.rb project.
The project consists of the following gems:

include::../../language-guides/ruby/ruby.adoc[tags=neo4jrb-lib]

Specifically in this guide, we will be using the `ActiveNode` and `ActiveRel` modules from the `neo4j` gem to model nodes and relationships from our database.

[#project-setup]
== Setup

The following example is in Ruby on Rails, but there is a link:#_an_example_sinatra_application[Sinatra example^] below.

Here, we describe how to create a fresh Rails application with Neo4j as the database.
If you have an existing Rails application, you can refer to the link:http://neo4jrb.readthedocs.org/en/5.2.x/Setup.html#adding-the-gem-to-an-existing-project[Neo4j.rb documentation^].

Here is how you would setup your asset portal Rails app:

[source,bash]
----
rails new asset_portal -m http://neo4jrb.io/neo4j/neo4j.rb -O
cd asset_portal
rake neo4j:install[community-latest]
rake neo4j:start
----

What do these commands do?

The first creates a new Rails app skipping `ActiveRecord` (the `-O` flag) and setting up Neo4j.rb in your project (the `-m` flag).
Then, we change into our directory and install the latest version of the community edition of Neo4j into our app directory (into `db/neo4j/development/`).
Last, we start up our copy of Neo4j.

Next, you should open up your `config/application.rb` file and find the `config.neo4j.\*` lines.
Here, you have a choice between *embedded* and *server* modes:

 * Server mode allows you to connect to Neo4j via it's HTTP JSON APIs.
 * Embedded mode requires JRuby and allows you to run Neo4j as part of your JRuby process.
 This gives you access to the link:http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/javadocs/[Neo4j Java APIs] directly.

By default, you will be configured to Neo4j in server mode on the default port (7474).
If you would like something other than the default console, take a look at the link:http://neo4jrb.readthedocs.org/en/5.2.x/Setup.html#rails-configuration[documentation^].

****
[WARNING]
By default the `rake neo4j:install` command disables Neo4j's authentication.
It is suggested that you enable the authentication for any exposed Neo4j instances.
****

[#create-models]
== Create Basic Models

In this guide, we will be setting up different `ActiveNode` models, which will serve as assets.
This is a textbook example of where we can use class inheritance in Neo4j.rb.
First, we create some basic models:

[source,bash]
----
rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
rails generate scaffold Category name:string
rails generate scaffold Asset title:string
----

This will generate link:http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-generate[scaffolds^] just like any Rails application, with the exception that the models will be `ActiveNode` models rather than `ActiveRecord` models and will look like this:

.app/models/user.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class User
  include Neo4j::ActiveNode
  property :name, type: String
  property :email, type: String
end
----

Since Neo4j is schemaless, we need to define our properties in our model.

****
[NOTE]
By default there will be a `uuid` property created on our model.
If you would like to define your own unique identifier you can use the `id_property` method.
Either can be accessed or changed via the `\#id` and `\#id=` methods.
****

To learn more about properties, check out this short screencast.

++++
<div class="responsive-embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2pCSQkHkPC8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
++++

Once we've set up those models, we can define our asset models like so:

[source,bash]
----
rails generate scaffold Book isbn:string title:string year_published:integer author:references category:references
----

That should generate a model that looks like this:

.app/models/book.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class Book
  include Neo4j::ActiveNode
  property :isbn, type: String
  property :title, type: String
  property :year_published, type: Integer

  has_one :in_or_out_or_both, :author, type: :FILL_IN_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_HERE
  has_one :in_or_out_or_both, :category, type: :FILL_IN_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_HERE

end
----

You should change that to look like the following (note the `Asset` superclass definition):

.app/models/book.rb
[source,ruby]
----
class Book < Asset
  id_property :isbn
  property :year_published, type: Integer

  has_one :in, :author, type: :CREATED, model_class: :User
  has_one :out, :category, type: :HAS_CATEGORY
end
----

****
[NOTE]
You can remove the `title` property because it is inherited from the `Asset` model.
****

****
[NOTE]
We also need to specify our Neo4j relationship directions and types here.
Since `author` isn't enough for `ActiveNode` to understand that we want to reference users, we specify a `model_class` option.
****

By inheriting from `Asset`, our `Book` model will create nodes with two labels (`Book` and `Asset`).
Likewise, when you query for nodes via the `Book` model, it will only find nodes which have both labels.

Lastly, we just need to make a couple of small fixes.
Change these lines to get the names of book authors and categories:

.app/views/books/index.html.erb
[source,erb]
----
<td><%= book.author.try(:name) %></td>
<td><%= book.category.try(:name) %></td>
----

And change these lines to be able to choose the author when creating or editing books:

.app/views/books/_form.html.erb
[source,erb]
----
<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :author %><br>
  <%= f.select :author, options_from_collection_for_select(User.all, :id, :name, @book.author.try(:id)), include_blank: true %>
</div>
<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :category %><br>
  <%= f.select :category, options_from_collection_for_select(Category.order(:name), :id, :name, @book.category.try(:id)), include_blank: true %>
</div>
----

So that you can set your associations, change the `book_params` method in the `BooksController` to remove the `\_id`:

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
def book_params
  params.require(:book).permit(:isbn, :title, :year_published, :author, :category)
end
----

[#run-migrations]
== Running the migrations

Now that we have created our scaffolding, let's run the migrations to create constraints for our models and start up our Rails server:

[source,bash]
----
rake neo4j:migrate
rails s
open http://localhost:3000/books
----

From there, you can create, update, browse, and delete books via the scaffolding.
You can visit `/books`, `/users`, and `/categories` to get entry points into the various sections.

[#power-up]
== The Fun Stuff

If you just wanted to do simple CRUD operations, there are plenty of other databases to choose from.
How can we do something a bit more fun using the power of Neo4j?

=== Eager Loading

First, let's look at a performance improvement, which is not available from `ActiveRecord`.
When you go to your list of books, you should see something like this in your log:

.log/development.log
[source,log]
----
Started GET "/books/" for ::1 at 2016-12-23 14:50:39 -0500
Processing by BooksController#index as HTML
  Rendering books/index.html.erb within layouts/application

 HTTP REQUEST: 5ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)

 Book#category MATCH (previous:`Book`:`Asset`) WHERE (ID(previous) = {ID_previous}) OPTIONAL MATCH (previous)-[rel1:`HAS_CATEGORY`]->(next:`Category`) RETURN ID(previous), collect(next) | {:ID_previous=>4}
 HTTP REQUEST: 4ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)
  Rendered books/index.html.erb within layouts/application (32.7ms)
Completed 200 OK in 84ms (Views: 81.5ms)
----

If you find that a bit hard to read, then you can add the following line to your application's configuration:

.config/application.rb
[source,ruby]
----
config.neo4j.pretty_logged_cypher_queries = true
----

****
[IMPORTANT]
Don't forget to restart your Rails server!
****

Once you complete that, your log will look more like this:

.log/development.log
[source,log]
----
Started GET "/books/" for ::1 at 2016-12-23 14:51:34 -0500
Processing by BooksController#index as HTML
  Rendering books/index.html.erb within layouts/application
 Book
  MATCH (n:`Book`:`Asset`)
  RETURN n
 HTTP REQUEST: 5ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)
 Book#author
  MATCH (previous:`Book`:`Asset`)
  WHERE (ID(previous) = {ID_previous})
  OPTIONAL MATCH (previous)<-[rel1:`CREATED`]-(next:`User`)
  RETURN
    ID(previous),
    collect(next) | {:ID_previous=>4}
 HTTP REQUEST: 4ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)
 Book#category
  MATCH (previous:`Book`:`Asset`)
  WHERE (ID(previous) = {ID_previous})
  OPTIONAL MATCH (previous)-[rel1:`HAS_CATEGORY`]->(next:`Category`)
  RETURN
    ID(previous),
    collect(next) | {:ID_previous=>4}
 HTTP REQUEST: 3ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)
  Rendered books/index.html.erb within layouts/application (20.2ms)
Completed 200 OK in 51ms (Views: 48.3ms)
----

First, the books are loaded, and then separate queries are made to get all of the authors and categories for those books.

With `ActiveRecord`, you would need to specify an `includes` in order to make this happen rather than having each entity loaded individually.
`ActiveNode`, on the other hand, makes the assumption that if you refer to an association from a list of items, you are almost certainly going to want that association for all of the objects.

[#step-further]
== One Step Further

But we can do better!
Now, modify the `index` action of the `BooksController` like so:

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
def index
  @books = Book.all.with_associations(:author, :category)
end
----

The `with_associations` method is similar to `includes`, except that our associations are loaded *_in the same query_* using the `collect()` function demonstrated earlier.

.log/development.log
[source,log]
----
Started GET "/books/" for ::1 at 2016-12-23 14:52:16 -0500
Processing by BooksController#index as HTML
  Rendering books/index.html.erb within layouts/application
 Book
  MATCH (n:`Book`:`Asset`)
  WITH n
  OPTIONAL MATCH (n)<-[:`CREATED`]-(author)
  WHERE (author:`User`)
  WITH
    n,
    collect(author) AS author_collection
  OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[:`HAS_CATEGORY`]->(category)
  WHERE (category:`Category`)
  WITH
    n,
    collect(category) AS category_collection,
    author_collection
  RETURN
    n,
    [author_collection,category_collection]
 HTTP REQUEST: 6ms POST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit (1 bytes)
  Rendered books/index.html.erb within layouts/application (11.8ms)
Completed 200 OK in 46ms (Views: 43.6ms)
----

What we get is a list of `Book` objects that are pre-populated with authors and categories.

[#recommendations]
== Recommendations

You may have heard that Neo4j makes building recommendations from your data easy.
Let's take a look at how we might make some recommendations.
For this, we are going to introduce `has_many` associations.
Since entities are connected via relationships in Neo4j, the database doesn't draw any distinction for when we want to have a single relationship or many to/from a node.
In our Ruby apps, however, it is often convenient to be able to draw this distinction.

To learn more about associations, check out this short screencast.

++++
<div class="responsive-embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/veqIfIqtoNc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
++++

First, change the `category` association for the `Book` model:

.app/models/book.rb
[source,ruby]
----
has_many :out, :categories, type: :HAS_CATEGORY
----

Don't forget to change the `:category` argument in the `with_associations` call in the controller to `:categories` like below.

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
  def index
    @books = Book.all.with_associations(:author, :categories)
----

Then add a `books` association to the `Category` model:

.app/models/category.rb
[source,ruby]
----
has_many :in, :books, origin: :categories
----

Since we have changed the `has_one` to `has_many` for the book categories, we should update our scaffold UI to match:

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
def index
  @books = Book.all.with_associations(:author, :categories)
end

... Further down ...

def book_params
  params.require(:book).permit(:isbn, :title, :year_published, :author, :category_ids => [])
end
----

.app/views/books/index.html.erb
[source,erb]
----
<th>Categories</th>

... Further down ...

<td>
  <ul>
  <% book.categories.each do |category| %>
    <li><%= link_to category.name, category %></li>
  <% end %>
  </ul>
</td>
----

.app/views/books/_form.html.erb
[source,erb]
----
<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :categories %><br>
  <%= f.select :category_ids, options_from_collection_for_select(Category.order(:name), :id, :name, @book.categories.map(&:id)), {include_blank: true}, {multiple: true, size: 5} %>
</div>
----

.app/views/books/show.html.erb
[source,erb]
----
<p>
  <strong>Categories:</strong>
  <%= @book.categories.map(&:name).to_sentence %>
</p>
----

Whew!

Now, with the ability for a book to have many categories and for a category to have many books, you can have a much better picture about recommending books.

[#query-recommendations]
== Querying for Recommendations

It is simple to get a start on querying potential recommendations.
Try running this in your Rails console:

[source,ruby]
----
Book.all.categories.books.to_a
----

It should show you the query which was made and it should look something like:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:`Book`:`Asset`)
MATCH n-[rel1:`HAS_CATEGORY`]->(node3:`Category`)
MATCH node3<-[rel2:`HAS_CATEGORY`]-(result_books:`Book`:`Asset`)
RETURN result_books
----

This query is finding all of the books that share categories with all other books.
This is not particularly useful until we start introducing some variables.
In the `neo4j` gem, this is called _association chaining_.
For more information about association chaining, check out this short screencast:

++++
<div class="responsive-embed">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUAl9ov22j4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
++++

[#category-query]
== Finding Shared Categories

What if you wanted to list every book and find out, for every other book with which it shares a category, how many categories it shares?

[source,ruby]
----
Book.as(:book).
  categories(:category).
  books(:other_book).
  pluck('book', 'other_book', 'count(category)')
----

Notice how we are starting to assign variables.
These eventually become the variables in the cypher query made to Neo4j.

Taking it a step further, let's create a query which finds, all the books that share at least two categories.
We can also display these recommendations in our app like so:

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
@recommendations = Book.as(:book).
                    categories(:category).
                    books(:other_book).
                    where('book <> other_book').
                    query.
                    with('book, other_book, count(category) AS count').
                    where('count > 1').
                    pluck('book.isbn', 'collect(other_book)')
@recommendations = Hash[*@recommendations.flatten(1)]
----

.app/views/books/index.html.erb
[source, erb]
----
<th>Recommendations</th>

... Further down ...

<td><%= (@recommendations[book.isbn] || []).map(&:title).to_sentence %></td>
----

Of course, we don't want to put too much logic in the controller, so we can extract this to a model class method:

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
Book.recommendations
----

.app/controllers/books_controller.rb
[source,ruby]
----
def self.recommendations
  recommendations = all(:book).
                      categories(:category).
                      books(:other_book).
                      where('book <> other_book').
                      query.
                      with('book, other_book, count(category) AS count').
                      where('count > 1').
                      pluck('book.isbn', 'collect(other_book)')

  Hash[*recommendations.flatten(1)]
end
----

Because the `all` method starts it off, we can actually add this to an existing chain rather than just calling it on the `Book` model.
For example, if we had a `recent` scope which only gave us books from the past ten years:

[source,ruby]
----
Book.recent.recommendations
----

You can also view Sintra example applications for the link:https://github.com/neo4j-examples/movies-ruby-neo4j-core[neo4j-core^] and link:https://github.com/neo4j-examples/movies-ruby-neo4jrb[neo4j^] gems.

=== The asset_portal application

You can find the result of this guide in its link:https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4jrb_guide_asset_portal[GitHub repository^].
If you would like to play with a more developed application, check out our link:https://github.com/neo4j-examples/asset_portal[asset_portal] app.
The project introduces a single `AssetController` to avoid the duplication from this guide and also uses other tools like link:http://semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI^] for a cleaner interface.

=== Getting Help

The maintainers of the `Neo4j.rb` project love to help!
There is a wonderful link:https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Online Community^] if you have questions about installation, configuration, Cypher, or any topic.

=== Integrations with other gems

* link:/developer/ruby/[Building Applications with Ruby]

////
== Unimplemented ideas:

* When the engine gem is available, refer to that along with the `asset_portal` repo

* Options
** Switching entirely to Neo4j
** Using Neo4j and another database for separate entities
** Using Neo4j to replicate some or all of an existing database
*** Mongo: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j_doc_manager
*** SQL:
**** https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4apis-activerecord
**** WAY OUT OF DATE: https://github.com/neoid-gem/neoid
** Doesn't matter too much as the neo4j.rb gems don't conflict with other object mappers

* Usage
** Cool things that you can do:
*** Realize that you need to add a node / relationship (just add it to the models)
*** Connected data query
