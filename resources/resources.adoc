[#graphgist-examples]
== Neo4j Graph Gist Examples

Neo4j Graph Gists are interactive, live graph examples for a variety of use-cases.

They are described by simple text documents containing data models and use cases in prose and pictures.
More importantly they are visualized in interactive datasets (provided in Cypher) with live queries representing use-cases on that example data.
