=== Introduction

In Neo4j 2.3 we introduced the ability to run custom "slideshows" in the Neo4j Browser, similar to the existing {play}movie%20graph[`:play movie graph`^].

These guides allow to provide a guided tour to a data set or use case.
Your users can interactively *read* through the slideshow, *execute* statements to import or query the data or look at pictures, videos or other media for detailed explanations.
You can also inlcude special links for interacting with the Neo4j browser.

We use these guides ourselves in many areas:

* http://neo4j.com/sandbox[The new Neo4j Sandbox^]
* http://neo4j.com/graphacademy[Online and classroom training^]
* Meetups and presentations, e.g. Data Journalism {play}http://guides.neo4j.com/ddj/[`:play http://guides.neo4j.com/ddj/`^]
* Exploration of interesting datasets, +
like TrumpWorld {play}http://guides.neo4j.com/trumpworld[`:play http://guides.neo4j.com/trumpworld`^]
* Rendering http://portal.graphgist.org[GraphGists^] as Guides

image::{img}browser-guide-northwind.jpg[]

Others have used them too, here a few examples:

* The https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database[Panama Papers Download^] comes with a comprehensive guide
* http://blog.bruggen.com/search/label/beergraphguide[Rik van Bruggens Beer Graph^]
* Daniel Himmelsteins https://thinklab.com/discussion/hosting-hetionet-in-the-cloud-creating-a-public-neo4j-instance/216[Protein Networks (Hetnet)^]
* Will Lyons Game of Thrones Graph: {play}http://guides.neo4j.com/got[`:play http://guides.neo4j.com/got`^]
* https://twitter.com/graphcommons/status/815999498245853185[GraphCommons Graphs^]

=== Technical Background

The browser guides are simple HTML pages with one section per slide.
The users can interactively page through the slideshow, execute statements from `<pre/>` areas to import or query the data or look at pictures, videos or other media for detailed explanations.
Of course you can use other HTML elements like tables, bullets, links etc.
There are some special CSS classes that interact actions within Neo4j Browser, e.g. for `:play` or `:help` commands.

image::{img}browser-guide-form-fields.jpg[link="{play}northwind%20graph"]

Since Neo4j 3.1 it is also possible to provide *form-fields* within the guides whose input is automatically included in the text on slides and in statements.
This is similar to the built-in {play}query%20template[`:play query template`^]

The guides can be hosted anywhere, for security reasons you have to *whitelist any domain* besides `guides.neo4j.com` and `localhost` in your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`.

----
# comma separated list of base-urls, or * for everything
browser.remote_content_hostname_whitelist=http://example.com
----

The server hosting the guide has to support proper CORS headers for both GET and OPTIONS requests, because the Neo4j Browser accesses a foreign URL.
So unfortunately GitHub pages and Dropbox folders don't work, but S3 can be configured to work well enough (or a custom Python or Java webserver).

[WARNING]
For security reasons, Javascript and Angular tags are stripped from the HTML, even from whitelisted sources.

[WARNING]
If your Neo4j instance is accessed via a `https://` URL, only guides hosted on `https://` URLs will render.
Currently, as of April 2017, guides.neo4j.com does not support `https`.

You can also provide your guide as a startup URL in two ways:

.add play command as setting in neo4j.conf
----
browser.post_connect_cmd=play <guide url or name>

browser.post_connect_cmd=play http://guides.neo4j.com/apoc
# or
browser.post_connect_cmd=play intro
----

.use URL parameters in a link, like we do on this page
[subs=attributes]
----
{play}&lt;guide url or name&gt;

{play}http://guides.neo4j.com/got

{play}northwind%20graph
----

=== Slide Format and Creation

The HTML format is https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-guides/blob/master/docs/html-guides.adoc[described in detail here^].
Don't worry, you do not have to create the HTML manually.
Although you can fine tune the generated HTML from the next step afterwards.

To make it easier to create Browser Guides, we created a https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-guides[simple tooling repository^] that uses AsciiDoc as source format and a HTML template with the slide structure.

AsciiDoc is used in many places, e.g. for O'Reilly books, many Documentation Manuals (ours too), these developer pages, our http://neo4j.com/developer/kb[knowledge base], http://portal.graphgist.org/about[GraphGists^] but also in Readme's and Wiki's on GitHub.
It was developed for technical documentation, and is more powerful than Markdown.

You can find a simple https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/blob/master/gists/syntax.adoc[syntax overview here^].

We use the http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor] toolchain and a variant of its https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends/tree/master/erb/html5[HTML5 erb-templates^].

Our process is straightforward. 

1. Just find or create a simple AsciiDoc file (see below) and convert it to the slide-html. 
2. Each second-level header is turned into a new slide, and `[source,cypher]` blocks into clickable statements.
3. Otherwise all regular HTML transformations apply.
4. For deep details on the AsciiDoc syntax, please see the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[AsciiDoctor User Manual^]

=== Worked Example

Clone and enter our repository and start editing your first guide.

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-guides
cd neo4j-guides
edit adoc/test.adoc
----

.test.adoc

 = A Test Guide
 
 == First Slide: Media
 
 image::https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/201120[width=200,float=right]

 This is just a test guide.

 But it comes with a picture and a video:

 ++++
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7f2tGsNSck?showinfo=0&controls=2&autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 ++++
 
 == Second Slide: Statements
 
 === Creating Data
 
 The area below becomes a clickable statement.
 
 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (db:Database {name:"Neo4j"})
 RETURN db
 ----
 
 === Querying Data
 :name: pass:a['<span value-key="name">Neo4j</span>']
 
 We use a form field here: 
 
 ++++
 <input style="display:inline;width:30%;" value-for="name" class="form-control" value="Neo4j" size="40">
 ++++
 
 [source,cypher,subs=attributes]
 ----
 MATCH (db:Database {name:{name}})
 RETURN db
 ----
 
 == Third Slide: Links
 
 * http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher[Learn more about Cypher]
 * pass:a[<a help-topic='keys'>Help Keys</a>]
 * pass:a[<a play-topic='http://guides.neo4j.com/'>Another Guide</a>]
 
 image::https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/201120[width=100,link="http://example.com"]
----

After saving the file, pass it to the `run.sh` script to convert to the HTML slides.

----
./run.sh adoc/test.adoc html/test.html

# optional arguments, leveloffset - to change the heading level up or down, base-url and additional attributes
./run.sh path/to/test.adoc path/to/test.html [+1] http://example.com/guides/test

# run the local python server to serve on localhost:8001
python http-server.py
----

Test in your local browser: 
{play}http://localhost:8001/html/test.html[`:play http://localhost:8001/html/test.html`^]

----
# then upload the file to your target server, e.g.
s3cmd put -P html/test.html s3://guides.example.com/test
----

And test it again: `:play http://guides.example.com/test`

==== Guide from GDOC

Something that is also really useful is to create guides from a collaboratively edited Google document.

Just create a Google document with AsciiDoc content (like the one above) for collaborative editing.
Make it publicly readable - in sharing settings enable: "everyone with link can read".

Get the download URL from "Download as Plain Text" and render to a browser guide like we did before.

.gdoc2guide.sh
----
id=${1-"1HY3AX6dvd8UtJhp5XAsyFsQ0oyC6Z0pbwJvkyr4WHtM"}
name=${2-network}
# use your plain-text download link format here
url="https://docs.google.com/a/neotechnology.com/document/export?format=txt&id=${id}"

curl -sL "$url" -o adoc/$name.adoc 
./run.sh adoc/$name.adoc html/$name.html 
s3cmd put -P html/$name.html s3://guides.neo4j.com/$name
----

==== HetNet Protein Networks - Daniel Himmelstein

Daniel used Browser Guides to represent the topic of his PhD thesis - Protein Networks in a Graph Database.

He https://thinklab.com/discussion/hosting-hetionet-in-the-cloud-creating-a-public-neo4j-instance/216[details the process] of setting up a public server for hosting the dataset as well as the steps involved in creating the guides in this article.

Daniel also presented about his research at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhAlNgjvMA[GraphConnect San Francisco].

==== Game of Thrones Guide

After the mathematicians Andrew Beveridge and Jie Shan published the "Network of Thrones" reseearch paper, William Lyon took the data (with permission) of co-occurrence of characters in volume 3 of "Game of Thrones" and turned it into a Neo4j Graph database.

Using that popular dataset Will explains the basic workings of a graph database and then expands into http://www.lyonwj.com/2016/06/26/graph-of-thrones-neo4j-social-network-analysis/[data science with social network analysis and graph algorithms].

The guide turns Wills blog post into an interactive experience.
// You can find https://github.com/johnymontana/graph-of-thrones[his repository here].

{play}http://guides.neo4j.com/got[`:play http://guides.neo4j.com/got`^]


We also created a separate "Game of Thrones" guide that aims at recreating the whole universe using data from a variety of sources.
It uses this https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bXXR-7rJMvM56Fc52qme1kriQPIFDHUQ3PzhwPkKzSY/edit#slide=id.g147007f109_0_125[set of accompanying slides] to teach about Neo4j.
