Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser].
Then install the Movies data-set with `:play movies`, click the statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

If all is well, start the app with Hypnotoad (included in the
Mojolicious distribution):
