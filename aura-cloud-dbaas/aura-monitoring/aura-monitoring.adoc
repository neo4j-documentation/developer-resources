.Goals
[abstract]
In this page, we will learn how to monitor our Neo4j Aura database.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
We should have created and started a Neo4j Aura database instance.
If we have not already, we can follow the instructions in the link:https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037562253-Working-with-Neo4j-Aura[getting started guide] to step through the process.

[role=expertise]

Now that we've created our Neo4j Aura database, we're going to learn how to monitor it.

[#aura-metrics]
== Built-in metrics

If we open our https://console.neo4j.io/#databases[Neo4j Aura Console Dashboard^], we'll see a list of our databases.


image::{img}dbaas_database_created.png[link="{img}dbaas_database_created.png",role="popup-link"]

We'll click on the name of our database, which will take us to the database overview page:


image::{img}dbaas_database_created_highlight_name.png[link="{img}dbaas_database_created_highlight_name.png",role="popup-link"]

Once we've clicked this button, we'll see the following screen, which gives us a high level overview of some important metrics:

image::{img}dbaas_database_overview.png[link="{img}dbaas_database_overview.png",role="popup-link"]

These metrics should be sufficient for understanding what's happening in the Aura database, but if you think that there's something missing don't hesitate to https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/requests/new[submit a support ticket^] and our team will be happy to help.

// == Halin
//
// Halin is Neo4j's monitoring and management tool.
// It can be https://install.graphapp.io[installed as a Neo4j Desktop Graph App^] and there is a https://halin.graphapp.io/[hosted version^] as well.
//
// We can learn more about the Halin tool on its https://neo4j.com/labs/halin/[Neo4j Labs product page^].

// We'll use the hosted version in this tutorial.

// If we navigate to https://halin.graphapp.io/[halin.graphapp.io^], we'll see the following screen requesting our database credentials:
//
// image::{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_login.png[link="{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_login.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// The default username is `neo4j` and the default password is generated on database creation.
// In the host field we need to enter the host of our database, which is the Bolt URI minus the protocol information.
//
// image::{img}dbaas_database_created_highlight_browser.png[link="{img}dbaas_database_created_highlight_browser.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// In the example above, our Bolt URI is `bolt+routing://178c6768.databases.neo4j.io`, and our host would therefore be `178c6768.databases.neo4j.io`.
//
// Once we've filled in those details we'll see the following overview screen:
//
// image::{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_overview.png[link="{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_overview.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// This is the best screen for getting an overall summary of what's happening with your database.
//
// === Power Users
//
// The overview screen only touches the surface of what Halin has to offer.
// For power users there are many other features, which are covered in detail in David Allen's online meetup talk:
//

// <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKndQ2qF5ts" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
// ++++
//
// Let's explore one of these power user features - viewing the queries running on cluster members.
// We can interrogate individual cluster members by clicking on the `Cluster members` tab, which is the 2nd one down:
//
// image::{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_select_members.png[link="{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_select_members.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// We can then click on the `Queries` tab to see which queries are currently running on that cluster member:
//
// image::{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_queries.png[link="{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_queries.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// In this screenshot we can see that we've got a long running query, on line 1, that we probably want to kill.
// We can do that by clicking on the `X` button:
//
// image::{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_kill_query.png[link="{img}dbaas_monitoring_halin_kill_query.png",role="popup-link"]
//
// Once we've done this a request will be sent to the database to terminate that query, and it will be removed from the query view.
