<div class="card card-3">
<p>Hello aspiring graphistas,</p>

<p>Welcome to my <i><b>Intro to Graph Databases</b></i> video series.  I created this series to teach people of all levels how graph databases work and when they're best applied. </p>

<p>If you're already familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, you may skip some of the beginning content (or watch at 1.5x as many of us do!).</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy and stay in touch on the <a href="https://community.neo4j.com/">Community Site</a> if you have any questions or problems during your learning journey.  If you'd prefer courses that mix video content with writtent content, exercises and quizes, please check out <a href="/graphacademy/online-training/">Neo4j GraphAcademy online training</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br /><br />
-Ryan Boyd<br />
Director of Developer Relations @ Neo4j</p>

Teaches how the property graph represents data, starting with a basic example: Dan Loves Ann. Discusses nodes, relationships, and properties on both nodes and relationships. Labels, directionality, and Cypher CREATE statements are also introduced.

Ready to build your application with Neo4j? This video introduces you to the three key steps: creating the model, loading data, querying.  Much of the episode covers moving from RDBMS to Graphs.  As David Meza from NASA <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmeza1/status/673948367140069376">says</a>, "I love Neo4j because I can explore relationships faster than you can say SQL JOIN.

This episode of the Intro to Graph Databases Series dives a little deeper on Cypher, the graph query language. It discusses key elements of the Cypher syntax, including comparison operators, aggregation functions and boolean operators. The video also explains how aggregates are done differently in Cypher vs SQL and covers high level filtering techniques via the WHERE clause.
