.Goals
[abstract]
This guide explains how to deploy a single instance of Neo4j on Google Cloud Platform.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to run and operate Neo4j locally.
Knowledge of link:/developer/language-guides/[remote drivers] to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database.

[#neo4j-gcp]
Before continuing with the guide, make sure you have installed the Google Cloud SDK and authenticated the gcloud command line interface.
More information on these steps is provided in the link:{opsmanual}/cloud-deployments/neo4j-gcp/single-instance-vm/#_prerequisites_2[documentation^].

[NOTE]
--
For deploying a Neo4j cluster in GCP, see link:/developer/neo4j-google-cloud-launcher/[this guide^].

Let's get started!

[#firewall-rules]
== Create Firewall Rules

By default, Google will not let traffic in and out of instances unless we specify to allow it.
So, we will need to define a firewall rule to allow traffic on specific ports, though we don't have to open port 22 for SSH, as that is already done.

Command syntax for the firewall rule is shown and explained in the link:{opsmanual}/cloud-deployments/neo4j-gcp/single-instance-vm/#_create_a_firewall_rule_to_access_your_instance[Neo4j documentation^].

In Google's Cloud Console, here's what your rule should look like:

[#compute-instance]
== Create a Google Compute Instance from the Neo4j Public Image

Launching the instance is a single command:

[source,shell]
----
gcloud config set project my-project-id
gcloud compute instances create my-neo4j-instance \
    --image neo4j-enterprise-1-3-4-9-apoc \
    --tags neo4j \
    --image-project launcher-public
----

The first line sets your project configuration to ensure you know where you are launching your instance.
The second line launches an image found in a public project that we have provided.
The image name `neo4j-enterprise-1-3-4-9-apoc` corresponds to an Ubuntu-based image that contains Neo4j 1:3.3.9 with the APOC plugin.

If you get an "image not found" error, this may mean you are attempting to launch a version that Neo4j has not published.

Note that the `gcloud` tool comes with many command line options that are not covered here.
Consult the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create[GCloud documentation^] for a large number of options dealing with machine type, memory, available storage, and so on.

The `--tags` argument is important because it allows us to configure the correct network 
permissions in the next step.
By default, Google will block all external access to the network services unless you open them.

You know that the launch succeeded when you see output like this:

[source,shell]
----
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/testbed-187316/zones/us-east1-b/instances/my-neo4j-instance].
NAME               ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
my-neo4j-instance  us-east1-b  n1-standard-1               10.142.0.3   35.231.125.253  RUNNING
----

[#access-instance]
== Access Your New Instance

Navigate to `https://[External_IP]:7473` and login with the user name `neo4j` and password `neo4j`.
You will be prompted to change the password immediately.

Because you do not have a hostname configured or a valid SSL certificate by default, your browser will warn you that the certificate is not trusted.
This is expected, and you can configure a certificate later, if you choose.

[#ssh-instance]
== How do I SSH into the instance?

You can run the following command to SSH into the instance:

[source,shell]
----
gcloud compute ssh my-neo4j-instance
----

Inside the VM, you can check the status of the neo4j service like this:

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo systemctl status neo4j
● neo4j.service - Neo4j Graph Database
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/neo4j.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-03-14 11:19:56 UTC; 15min ago
 Main PID: 1290 (pre-neo4j.sh)
    Tasks: 46
   Memory: 325.7M
      CPU: 20.690s
   CGroup: /system.slice/neo4j.service
           ├─1290 /bin/bash /etc/neo4j/pre-neo4j.sh
           └─1430 /usr/bin/java -cp /var/lib/neo4j/plugins:/etc/neo4j:/usr/share/neo4j/lib/*:/var/lib/neo4j/plugins/* -server -XX:+UseG1GC 
----

[#vm-workings]
== How your new virtual machine works

Please consult {opsmanual}/cloud-deployments/cloudVms/[Neo4j Cloud VMs^] for details on internals of virtual machines, including configure Neo4j inside of the VM and access various files.

[#delete-instance]
== Deleting the instance

Once we have finished using the instance, we can run the following command to delete it:

[source,shell]
----
gcloud compute instances delete my-neo4j-instance
----

[#gcp-resources]
== Questions?

You can ask questions and connect with other people launching Neo4j in the cloud through the https://community.neo4j.com/c/neo4j-graph-platform/cloud[cloud topic on the Community Site^].
