.Goals
[abstract]
This guide explains how to deploy a Neo4j Enterprise Causal Cluster via Google Cloud Launcher.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
. You have a Neo4j Enterprise license
. You should have familiarity with link:/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/causal-clustering/introduction/[causal cluster architecture].
. Knowledge of link:/developer/language-guides[remote drivers] to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database.

Let's get started!

=== Select Neo4j from the Google Cloud Launcher console

Select Neo4j from the Google Cloud Launcher console and click Launch on Compute Engine

=== Deploy Neo4j Enterprise

* Choose a name for your Neo4j instance
* Choose a machine type
* Select a number of core nodes in the cluster
* Click Deploy

* Once the deploy has finished, save the URL, username, and password for the next steps.

=== Start using Neo4j Browser

We're now ready to start using Neo4j!

Use your browser to access the URL provided in the previous step, and log in with the initial
username and password provided.   You may see an SSL warning screen, because the deployment
out of the box uses an unsigned SSL certificate.

The initial password is set to a strong random password, and is saved as a metadata entry
on the VMs themselves, so you can't lose it.

To verify that the cluster has formed correctly, run the cypher statement 
`CALL dbms.cluster.overview()`

You will know that everything is working fine when you see one `LEADER` with the remainder of
your nodes as `FOLLOWER`.  The IP addresses and endpoints will match what Compute Engine shows
you for your running instances.

=== How do I SSH into the instance?

On the deployment manager screen above, there is a button provided to SSH directly into the
first node of the cluster.  Cluster members are just regular Google Compute Engine VMs.  As
a result you can always access any of them via SSH; check your Compute Engine VMs, they will
be named `cluster-name-vm-1`, `cluster-name-vm-2`, and so on.

Using the Google Cloud CLI, you can access them via:

----
gcloud compute ssh my-cluster-deploy-vm-1
----

=== How the Virtual Machines Work

Please consult link:/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/neo4j-cloud-vms[Neo4j Cloud VMs] for details on internals of 
Google VMs, including how to stop and start system services, configure Neo4j inside of the VM, and more.

=== Your Cluster Default Configuration

The following notes are provided on your default cluster configuration.

* Ports 7687 (bolt) and 7473 (HTTPS access) are the only ports exposed to the entire internet.  Consider narrowing access to 
these ports to only your needed networks.  External unencrypted HTTP access is disabled by default.
* Ports 5000, 6000, and 7000 are enabled only for internal network access (`10.0.0.8`) as they are needed
for internal cluster communication.
* Because cloud VMs can start and stop with different IP addresses, the configuration of these
VMs is driven by a file in `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.template`.  Configuration changes should be made to
the template, **not** to the `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf` file, which is overwritten with template
substitutions at every startup.  The template allows you configure aspects of the cluster with
VM metadata; see the "Custom Metadata" on any of your launched VMs for examples.  The template's
behavior and layout matches the usual `neo4j.conf` file.

=== What's Next

* Visit the link:/docs/operations-manual/current/[Neo4j Operations Manual] for information on how
configure all aspects of your cluster
* Add users, and change passwords as necessary
* Consider creating DNS entries with Google to permit addressing your cluster with client applications
under a single host name.

=== Terminating the Deployment

Should you need to, you can tear down this infrasructure by using the deployment manager to delete
the deployment.  To ensure data safety, the disks that back the VMs will not be autodeleted if 
the cluster deployment is deleted.  These disks must be deleted separately, manually, if desired.
