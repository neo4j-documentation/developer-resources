Do you want to deploy Neo4j to the cloud?
This section features guides and tutorials to help you understand the available options.

Topics include:

* Deploying on Amazon EC2
* Deploying on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Deploying on Microsoft Azure
* Deploying on other PaaS
* Cloud Hosting Providers

== [.label]#Guide →# Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

There are several options for running on EC2, depending on what you want to do, detailed below.

=== Enterprise Causal Cluster in AWS Marketplace

link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07D441G55[Neo4j Enterprise Causal Clusters] can be launched directly.

This option launches a multi-VM clustered configuration, with the choice to configure a number of aspects of the
cluster, including number of core nodes, read replicas, hardware sizing, encrypted EBS volumes, and other options.

=== Launching Directly from an AMI

Instructions for launching VMs directly using Amazon's command line tool are provided 
in the article on link:/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/neo4j-cloud-aws-ec2-ami[Deploying Neo4j on EC2 using a custom Neo4j AMI].
Using this method, both Community and Enterprise options are available.

=== Community Edition in AWS Marketplace

link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071P26C9D[Neo4j Community can be installed from the AWS marketplace^].

We recommend that for security group settings, you select the option to "Create new security group based on seller settings".
This will ensure that when the instance is launched, the default ports that need to be open will be.

== [.label]#Guide →# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that 
Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, 
it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.

Running on Google Cloud is easy, and you have three options, depending on what you want to do.

=== Test Drive

A link:https://neo4j.orbitera.com/c2m/trials/signup?testDrive=1135[free test drive is available], 
which takes you through the basics of how to run Neo4j, access data using Cypher.  The test drive provides guided walk-throughs of use 
cases for graph databases.  Once you launch your test drive, you'll be provided with a user guide
explaining key concepts, use cases, and features.   The user guide will walk you through a series
of labs to help you tour the product and learn key concepts.

=== Single instances (VM based)

link:/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/neo4j-cloud-google-image[Follow these instructions] to 
launch a single instance from an image in minutes, with just a few commands.

=== Causal Clusters (VM Based)

link:https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/neo4j-public/neo4j-enterprise-causal-cluster[Neo4j Enterprise is registered in Google's Cloud Launcher], and users can launch a causal cluster in minutes.

For a walkthrough on how to use the Google Cloud Launcher, please consult link:/developer/neo4j-cloud-google-cloud-launcher/[the guide to deploying Neo4j Causal Clusters on GCP].

=== Google Kubernetes Marketplace (Docker Container Based)

link:https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/neo4j-public/causal-cluster-k8s[Neo4j Enterprise is available on Kubernetes Marketplace], so 
users may quickly launch Neo4j clusters into Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.

For a walk-through on how to use Neo4j with GKE, please consult the article link:https://medium.com/google-cloud/launching-neo4j-on-googles-kubernetes-marketplace-97c23c94e960[Launching Neo4j on Google Kubernetes Marketplace].

Technical artifacts and templates that support GKE link:https://github.com/neo-technology/neo4j-google-k8s-marketplace[can be found on GitHub].

== [.label]#Guide →# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers.

It provides software as a service, platform as a service and infrastructure as a service and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

Starting from version 3.2.0, link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-enterprise-edition?tab=PlansAndPrice[Neo4j can be installed from the Azure marketplace^].
You can read more in the link:https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-microsoft-azure-marketplace-part-1/[release blog post^].

== [.label]#Guide →# Kubernetes (Any Cloud)

For users who wish to run Neo4j in kubernetes clusters, Neo4j provides a link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/neo4j[public helm chart]
which permits easy installation using standard `kubectl` and `helm` tools.

For a walk-through of how to use the helm chart to get started quickly, please consult link:https://neo4j.com/blog/kubernetes-deploy-neo4j-clusters/[How to Use Kubernetes to Quickly Deploy Neo4j Clusters].
