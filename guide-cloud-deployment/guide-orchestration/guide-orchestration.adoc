This guide explains how to run Neo4j on orchestration frameworks such as Mesosphere DC/OS and Kubernetes.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with the orchestration framework on which you want to deploy.

Orchestration systems are systems for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
You can follow the guides below to run Neo4j on some popular orchestration systems.

=== Mesosphere DC/OS

link:https://docs.mesosphere.com/[Mesosphere DC/OS^] is built around the long established link:http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos^] project.
Mesos is used by companies such as Twitter, Apple, Netflix, or Airbnb to manage their production clusters.

Neo4j is link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-dcos[available as a Universe application^] and can be installed via the link:https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/[Marathon container orchestration platform^].

You can read more in the https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-mesosphere-dc-os/[release blog post^] or watch the presentation that Johannes Unterstein gave at the link:/developer/online-meetup/[Neo4j online meetup^].

=== Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications that builds on 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google.

Neo4j core servers can be installed using the StatefulSet abstraction, which was introduced as a beta feature in v1.5.0.
Read replicas can be installed using the replication controller abstraction.

Mark Needham's https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-kubernetes[neo4j-kubernetes^] repository has full instructions to get a cluster up and running.
You can also watch Dippy Aggarwal's talk from GraphConnect San Francisco 2016.
